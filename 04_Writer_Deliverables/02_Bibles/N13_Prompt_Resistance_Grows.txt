## YOUR TASK

Generate a complete Story Bible for the thirteenth 15-chapter novella. God-vessel factions escalate to open warfare (multi-directional conflict). Councilor Vren forced into alliance with resistance (corrupt politician becomes necessary ally). Orveth builds Corlexi fortifications. Jhace coordinates multi-front defense. Resistance network expands despite losses. First god-on-god violence formalizes. Military structure solidifies in resistance. This novella formalizes the shift to warfare.

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS

### What You MUST Present
- Open warfare between all four god-vessel factions (not just against resistance)
- Multi-front defense required (Jhace dealing with four separate threats)
- Councilor Vren as corrupt ally (not redeemed; useful; compromised)
- Orveth building geometric fortifications (Form doctrine manifested architecturally)
- Resistance network expanding (people choosing sides)
- First god-vessel-on-god-vessel violence visible
- Military structure formalizing in resistance
- Civic authority compromised by god-vessel pressure
- All events organic to faction competition

### What You MUST NOT Present
- NO hints that warfare is orchestrated
- NO foreshadowing of Vren's N16 death
- NO references to future novellas
- NO meta-awareness of larger military strategy
- NO suggestion that Jhace could have prevented escalation

## NOVELLA SCOPE (N13 ONLY)

### Major Events (IMMUTABLE)
- [ ] Chapter 1-4: God-vessel factions escalate to open warfare (multi-directional)
- [ ] Chapter 5-7: Councilor Vren approached by resistance; forced alliance
- [ ] Chapter 8-10: Jhace coordinates multi-front defense (four separate tactical problems)
- [ ] Chapter 11-13: First formalized god-on-god violence
- [ ] Chapter 14-15: Military structure solidifies; resistance becomes fourth faction

### Character Status at Start (from N12 end)
- **Jhace**: Accepting helplessness but coordinating defense; guilt drives strategy
- **Councilor Vren**: Corrupt politician; pressured by god-vessels; seeking protection
- **Orveth**: Building fortifications (geometric precision)
- **Thessa**: Operating forced-healing stations
- **Lysenne**: Conducting purges (Mobel strength visible)
- **Daric**: Spreading release doctrine (Eries philosophy)
- **Resistance**: ~150-200 members; forming military units

### Open Warfare (Multi-Directional)
- **Corlexi vs. Salee**: Geometric perfection vs. universal integration (incompatible doctrines)
- **Mobel vs. Eries**: Violent purification vs. peaceful dissolution (incompatible approaches)
- **Corlexi vs. Mobel**: Order vs. purity (both seeking cleanliness but different methods)
- **Salee vs. Eries**: Integration vs. release (both seeking mercy but opposite directions)
- **Resistance vs. all four**: Independence vs. assimilation/purification/integration/release

### Councilor Vren (Forced Alliance)
- Previously: Corrupt politician; served god-vessels (for protection money)
- Crisis: God-vessels demand total obedience; threatens his position
- Choice: Approach resistance for alternative protection
- Role: Provides civic intelligence and legitimacy to resistance
- Status: Not redeemed; still corrupt; but useful ally
- Loyalty: Conditional; survives if resistance survives

### Orveth's Fortifications (Geometric Perfection)
- Architecture-based Form doctrine
- Impossible geometric precision
- Fortifications are both beautiful and oppressive
- Represent Corlexi order imposed on landscape
- Become target for Jhace's resistance (N15)

### What Ends N13
- Open multi-faction warfare visible
- Councilor Vren allied with resistance
- Multi-front defense structure established
- First god-on-god violence formalized
- Military structure solidified in resistance
- Resistance positioned as fourth faction
- Resistance network grows to ~200+ members
- FORGE Turning mid-point; siege preparation beginning
