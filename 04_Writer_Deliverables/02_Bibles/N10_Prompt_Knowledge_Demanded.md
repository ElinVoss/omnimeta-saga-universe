## YOUR TASK

Generate a complete Story Bible for the tenth 15-chapter novella. This is the climactic novella of CRACK Turning. Infrastructure sabotage escalates. Dren injured (permanent disability). Vael becomes critical intelligence gatherer. First defectors appear from god-vessel factions. Resistance network fractures under pressure but holds. Protective instinct in Jhace intensifies (guilt accumulation). CRACK Turning concludes; FORGE Turning begins.

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS

### What You MUST Present
- Infrastructure sabotage as deliberate tactic (god-vessel factions weaponizing infrastructure)
- Dren's injury as tragic (disabling but not lethal; permanent consequences)
- Jhace feeling responsible for casualties (even when uncontrollable)
- Vael becoming critical intelligence gatherer (information becomes weapon)
- First defectors from god-vessel factions appearing (moral resistance within factions)
- Resistance network integrity tested (fractional stress but holds)
- Protective drive intensifying in Jhace (manifests as control need)
- All events organic to faction warfare escalation

### What You MUST NOT Present
- NO hints that sabotage is coordinated orchestration
- NO foreshadowing of FORGE Turning events
- NO references to future novellas
- NO meta-awareness of larger patterns
- NO suggestion that Jhace's guilt is manufactured

## NOVELLA SCOPE (N10 ONLY)

### Major Events (IMMUTABLE)
- [ ] Chapter 1-3: Infrastructure sabotage escalating (multiple sites attacked)
- [ ] Chapter 4-6: Dren injured in sabotage site; permanent disability results
- [ ] Chapter 7-9: Jhace feels responsible; protective instinct morphs into control need
- [ ] Chapter 10-12: Vael's intelligence work becomes critical (provides faction targeting data)
- [ ] Chapter 13-14: First god-vessel faction defectors appear (seeking refuge with resistance)
- [ ] Chapter 15: Resistance network fractured but intact; CRACK ends; FORGE begins

### Character Status at Start (from N09 end)
- **Jhace**: Normalized grief; hardened; protective drive intensifying
- **Dren**: Resistance member; active in construction/infrastructure repair
- **Vael**: Intelligence gatherer; positioning for critical role
- **Rennik**: Chief medic; treating casualties
- **Defectors**: Not yet present (appear Ch.13+)

### Dren's Injury (Permanent Disability)
- **Pre-injury**: Active in infrastructure repair; competent
- **Sabotage site**: Caught in collapse; survives but severely injured
- **Disability**: Spinal damage; cannot continue labor (permanent)
- **Role change**: Transitions to information/planning work (uses intelligence, not body)
- **Emotional impact**: Jhace feels responsible (reinforces protective guilt)

### Defectors (First God-Vessel Faction Members to Join Resistance)
- Appear in Ch.13+
- Come from all four factions (at least one from each by end)
- Reasons: Moral opposition to escalation; witnessing atrocities; refusing doctrine
- Bring insider knowledge (help resistance understand faction tactics)
- Not treated as spies; risk authentic (defection genuine)

### What Ends N10
- **CRACK Turning officially climaxes**
- Dren permanently disabled (visible consequence)
- Vael's intelligence critical (continues through N25)
- Defectors integrated (first of many)
- Resistance network fractured but holding
- Protective guilt accumulated in Jhace
- **FORGE Turning begins** (open ideological warfare)
