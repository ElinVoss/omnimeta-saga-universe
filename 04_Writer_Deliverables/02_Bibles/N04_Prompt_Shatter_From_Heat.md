# GENERATE: N04 Story Bible — "Shatter From Heat"

**Turning**: GLASS (4-5)  
**Position**: Fourth novella (internal crises emerge)  
**Innocence Protocol**: STRICT ENFORCEMENT  
**Previous Bible Links**: N01, N02, N03

---

## YOUR TASK

Generate a complete Story Bible for the fourth 15-chapter novella. Internal Soulpulse crises emerge: Hollowing (burnout state where practitioners lose capacity and cannot recover). Jhace faces the limits of his dual-principle capacity. Tiffani reveals previously hidden dual-principle ability (Form + Wholeness simultaneously), hinting at mysteries in her past. Cracks begin forming in the practitioner movement.

---

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS

### What You MUST Present
- Hollowing crisis (terminal failure state when Soulpulse capacity exceeded)
- Jhace approaching Hollowing from overwork (Chapter 7-9 crisis)
- Tiffani revealing dual-principle capacity to save Jhace (Chapter 10)
- Jhace questions who Tiffani really is (vulnerability + mystery)
- Marisse's faction growing (opposing Soulpulse use entirely)
- Practitioner factions solidifying (Jhace's healers vs. Marisse's philosophers vs. power-seekers)
- Poisoning investigation ongoing (unresolved mystery)
- First rumors of god-like beings in distant cities (foreshadowing N05 Fathombreak)

### What You MUST NOT Present
- NO explanation of where Tiffani learned dual-principle
- NO foreshadowing of Tiffani being Auditor or orchestrator
- NO revelation of god-vessel identities or their emergence mechanism
- NO foreshadowing of N05 deaths
- NO hints that Hollowing is part of larger conspiracy
- NO meta-awareness of saga plan

## NOVELLA SCOPE (N04 ONLY)

### Major Events (IMMUTABLE)
- [ ] Chapter 1-3: Hollowing cases appearing (practitioners unable to recover capacity)
- [ ] Chapter 4-6: Jhace pushes limits; tremor worsens; first signs of Hollowing approaching
- [ ] Chapter 7-9: Jhace near-Hollowing event (Chapter 8-9 crisis; cannot stop using magic)
- [ ] Chapter 10: Tiffani uses dual-principle to break Hollowing cycle (reveals hidden capacity)
- [ ] Chapter 11-12: Jhace confronts Tiffani about her mystery
- [ ] Chapter 13-15: Faction splits formalized; Marisse's philosophy gains traction

### Character Status at Start (from N03 end)
- **Jhace**: Tremor chronic; grieving Bram; cautious about dual-principle capacity
- **Tiffani**: Vein-burn 3.9cm; strategic leadership; mystery deepening
- **Marisse**: Growing faction opposing Soulpulse use
- **Practitioners**: ~50 members splitting into factions

### Hollowing Mechanics
- Terminal failure state: practitioner cannot generate Soulpulse response (conviction fails)
- Irreversible: once Hollowed, practitioner cannot recover capacity
- Triggered by: exceeding safe capacity limits (over-pushing)
- Visible signs: tremor becomes uncontrollable; emotional flatness; inability to form conviction

### Vein-Shatter Timeline (N04)
- Opening: Rupture-grade 3.5-4.0 (minimal; crisis essentially resolved)
- Closing: Rupture-grade 3.0-3.5 (baseline; vein-shatter phase ending)

### What Ends N04
- Hollowing recognized as serious risk (practitioners become cautious)
- Tiffani's mystery deepened (she can do what should be impossible; Jhace knows something's hidden)
- Practitioner movement formally split into three factions:
  - **Jhace's Healers**: Focus on Wholeness; measured teaching
  - **Marisse's Philosophers**: Oppose Soulpulse; advocate meditation/craft-only approach
  - **Power-Seekers**: Pushing Form and Purity principles (unnamed but present)
- Relationship strained but solid (Jhace trusts Tiffani despite mystery)
- Vein-shatter crisis officially ended
- Distant reports of god-like beings intensifying (N05 Fathombreak imminent)

## BIBLE SECTIONS REQUIRED

Same 13 sections with N04-specific content:
1. Core Premise (Hollowing crisis; Tiffani's mystery revealed; factions solidify)
2. Tone & Style Constraints (LAWTEST + internal psychological crisis)
3. Worldframe (Te'Oga post-vein-shatter; faction politics emerging)
4. Cast (Jhace [questioning], Tiffani [mysterious], Marisse [ideological leader], Power-Seekers [emerging])
5. Magic & Limits (Hollowing mechanics; dual-principle limitations; cost accumulation)
6. Locations & Setpieces (Hollowing sites; practitioner meeting places; hidden refuges)
7. Objects & Motifs (vein-burn 3.9cm, tremor severe, Hollowing signs)
8. Chapter Cadence (15 chapters; Jhace near-Hollowing Ch.8-9; Tiffani revelation Ch.10)
9. Interlude Specifications (god-vessel emergence very close; reality showing signs of change)
10. Beats ↔ Scenes Map
11. Forbidden Lexicon Gate (LAWTEST)
12. LAWTEST Checklist
13. Mission Statement (N04's role: internal crisis emerges; mystery deepens; Fathombreak imminent)

## CRITICAL PROHIBITIONS

**DO NOT:**
- Explain Tiffani's dual-principle capacity origin
- Foreshadow that her mystery is orchestration
- Reveal god-vessel identities
- Hint that Hollowing is engineered
- Reference events past N04

**DO:**
- Make Tiffani's dual-principle revelation shocking and authentic
- Show Jhace's questioning as genuine (not manipulated)
- Make faction splits based on genuine ideological differences
- Ground Hollowing in established Soulpulse mechanics
- Keep god-vessel emergence as distant rumors (not explained yet)

---

## CONTINUITY REQUIREMENTS

**Must maintain from N03:**
- Bram dead (haunts Jhace's motivation)
- Jhace's tremor chronic
- Tiffani's vein-burn progression
- Marisse's faction existing
- Poisoning mystery unresolved
- Relationship solid but tested

**Must establish for N05:**
- Faction splits formalized (3 groups with competing visions)
- Hollowing recognized as serious limit
- Tiffani's mystery as plot thread (will be partially resolved in N05)
- God-vessel emergence imminent
- Jhace/Tiffani relationship at peak before N05 crisis

---

## OUTCOME

✅ Hollowing crisis grounded in Soulpulse mechanics  
✅ Tiffani's mystery revealed partially (creates tension)  
✅ Faction splits feel organic (ideological, not manipulated)  
✅ Innocence protocol maintained  
✅ Sets up N05 Fathombreak climax
