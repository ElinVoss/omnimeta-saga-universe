# GENERATE: N02 Story Bible — "Light Cracks Through"

**Turning**: GLASS (2-5)  
**Position**: Second novella (builds on N01)  
**Innocence Protocol**: STRICT ENFORCEMENT  
**Previous Bible Link**: N01_Bible_Grip_That_Holds.md

## YOUR TASK

Generate a complete Story Bible for the second 15-chapter novella. This novella escalates the vein-shatter crisis that N01 introduced. Magic use expands globally; practitioners organize; first hints of ideology emerge; Tiffani and Jhace's partnership deepens under new strain.

---

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS

### What You MUST Present
- Vein-shatter stress-riser crisis (building catastrophe, not yet peak)
- More practitioners discovering magic independently
- Tiffani and Jhace's relationship tested by partnership scope expanding
- First appearances of people who will become god-vessels (not yet awakened)
- Soulpulse addiction beginning (practitioners pushing limits)
- Marisse (resistance leader) emerging as counterforce
- No death of major characters (save Bram for N03)
- Events still feel organic; Piercing consequences unfolding naturally

### What You MUST NOT Present
- NO foreshadowing of god-vessel transformation
- NO hints about Tiffani orchestrating events
- NO foreshadowing of N05 deaths or Fathombreak
- NO faction ideology warfare (emergence only)
- NO reference to N01-exclusive information being artificially known
- NO meta-awareness of saga trajectory

## NOVELLA SCOPE (N02 ONLY)

### Major Events (IMMUTABLE)
- [ ] Chapter 1-3: Vein-shatter stress increasing (minor followshocks daily)
- [ ] Chapter 4-5: First independent practitioner discoveries (outside Jhace/Tiffani)
- [ ] Chapter 6: Marisse introduced as emerging resistance leader
- [ ] Chapter 7-9: Tiffani and Jhace coordinate with growing practitioner group
- [ ] Chapter 10: Relationship strain (Tiffani wants larger scope; Jhace fears overreach)
- [ ] Chapter 12-13: Soulpulse addiction crisis (practitioner pushes limits; dies)
- [ ] Chapter 15: Stress-riser crisis resolved temporarily; larger threat hinted

### Character Status at Start (from N01 end)
- **Jhace**: Tremor established; Form-locking improving; hesitant about expanded teaching
- **Tiffani**: Vein-burn 3.5cm; vein-burn increasing (3.7cm by end); thinking strategically about movement building
- **Bram**: Loyal ally; no major arc (dies N03)
- **NEW**: Marisse appears (revolutionary thinker; no magic yet; organizes philosophy)

### Vein-Shatter Timeline (N02)
- Opening: Rupture-grade 4.5-5.5 (baseline from N01 end; relatively stable)
- Mid-novella: Rupture-grade 5.5-6.5 (stress-riser building; unpredictable)
- Closing: Rupture-grade resolved to 4.5 (temporary stabilization)

### What Ends N02
- Heat-grid fully operational; crisis management normalized
- Practitioner group growing to ~50 members
- Tiffani's vein-burn 3.7cm (visible progression)
- Jhace's tremor chronic (baseline accepted)
- Marisse established as philosophical counterforce to Tiffani's pragmatism
- Relationship deepened but strained (first real disagreement)
- Distant reports from other cities (other practitioners emerging independently)

5. Magic & Limits (Soulpulse capacity progression; addiction mechanics)
6. Locations & Setpieces (Grindheim expanded; practitioner gathering sites; hidden refuges)
7. Objects & Motifs (vein-burn progression, tremor worsening, stress-riser phenomenon)
8. Chapter Cadence (15 chapters with beat assignments; NO consecutive repeats from N01 beats)
9. Interlude Specifications (god-vessel emergence hints from other cities)

## CRITICAL PROHIBITIONS

**DO NOT:**
- Mention orchestration or Auditor role
- Foreshadow Marisse's fate in future novellas
- Hint that Jhace and Tiffani's disagreement is orchestrated tension
- Reveal god-vessel identities or foreshadow their transformation
- Reference events past N02

**DO:**
- Show Marisse as genuine ideological counterforce (not orchestrated)
- Present vein-shatter stress as natural phenomenon escalation
- Show Tiffani's strategic thinking as earned leadership, not orchestration
- Make addiction crisis feel like natural consequence of discovery
- Ground all events in material cause-effect

---

## CONTINUITY REQUIREMENTS

**Must maintain from N01:**
- Jhace's tremor baseline (can worsen, not improve)
- Tiffani's vein-burn progression (3.5cm → 3.7cm minimum)
- Heat-grid partial restoration state
- Bram's character (alive and loyal)
- Jhace/Tiffani relationship state (committed but testing partnership scope)
- Grindheim infrastructure state (70% functional at N02 start)

**Must establish for N03:**
- Bram positioned for death (no plot armor; vulnerable but not foreshadowed)
- Marisse established as enduring ideological counterforce
- Practitioner movement with ~50 members trained
- Soulpulse addiction as recognized crisis
- Relationship stress between Jhace (cautious) and Tiffani (ambitious)

## OUTCOME

✅ Escalates N01's crisis organically  
✅ Introduces Marisse as genuine counterforce  
✅ Shows Soulpulse addiction consequences  
✅ Tests partnership without foreshadowing orchestration  
✅ Maintains innocence protocol throughout
