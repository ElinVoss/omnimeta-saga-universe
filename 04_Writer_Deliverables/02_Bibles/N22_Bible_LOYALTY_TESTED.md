## YOUR TASK

Generate a complete Story Bible for the twenty-second 15-chapter novella. Rennik dies from Hollowing cascade (terminal; overwork during 22 novellas of continuous triage; cost accumulated to fatal level). Healing capacity reduced critically (resistance loses chief medical support). God-vessel factions also suffering losses (mutual attrition continuing). Stalemate solidifying further (acceptance of finite resources; mutual recognition of impasse). Bell-rope communication systems failing (connections breaking; splices fraying; backup communication systems failing). Final provisional measures being enacted (contingency plans activated). Mutual acceptance of attrition as permanent state becoming explicit. Jhace accepts terminal cost (understanding Rennik's death as inevitable consequence of his own decisions). This novella is CLEAR's attrition intensification: loyalty tested through resource scarcity; protective bonds tested by loss.

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS

### What You MUST Present

- Rennik's death from Hollowing cascade (terminal; earned through 22 novellas continuous medical work)
- Hollowing progression visible (vein-burn fully visible; tremor severe; conviction wavering then gone)
- Healing capacity reduced critically (resistance loses chief medical support; replacements inadequate)
- God-vessel factions also weakening (mutual attrition visible; no faction advancing)
- Stalemate solidifying explicitly (all sides accepting mutual limit)
- Bell-rope communication systems failing (connections breaking; splices fraying; backup systems failing)
- Communication breakdown visible (coordination becoming difficult; factions less able to coordinate)
- Final provisional measures enacted (contingency plans activated; reduced expectations)
- Mutual acceptance of attrition as permanent (explicit recognition of stalemate permanence)
- Position held → supplies diminish → tactical shift beat (holding position costs resources; supplies diminish; forced to shift tactics)
- All events organic to attrition phase culmination (no orchestration hints; natural consequence of grinding exhaustion)

### What You MUST NOT Present

- NO hints that Rennik's death is orchestrated or predetermined
- NO foreshadowing of specific battle events (N26+)
- NO references to N23-N30 or beyond
- NO meta-awareness that stalemate is designed outcome
- NO suggestion that communication failure is intentional sabotage
- NO provisional seal registry language removed from sections 1, 3, 7, 11
- NO guilty canon leakage (Tiffani remains dead; no larger design visible)

## NOVELLA SCOPE (N22 ONLY)

### Major Events (IMMUTABLE)

- [ ] Chapter 1-3: Rennik showing final Hollowing symptoms (tremor severe; conviction wavering; terminal status clear)
- [ ] Chapter 4-6: God-vessel factions also suffering visible losses (mutual attrition pattern clear)
- [ ] Chapter 7-9: Bell-rope communication systems failing (connections breaking; splices fraying; messages delayed/lost)
- [ ] Chapter 10-12: Rennik's Hollowing cascade terminal (conviction gone; body ceasing; death imminent)
- [ ] Chapter 13: **Rennik dies** (Hollowing terminal; quiet; no prolonged suffering; body simply ceases)
- [ ] Chapter 14-15: Healing capacity reduced; stalemate explicit; loyalty tested through grief and loss

### Character Status at Start (from N21 end)

- **Jhace**: Accepting sacrifice; mental preparation complete; loyalty to resistance tested by approaching losses
- **Rennik**: Chief medic; Hollowing cascade beginning; terminal status obvious; functional but declining
- **Resistance**: ~30-40 members; final positions held; defensive stance permanent
- **Brighble**: Intelligence network documenting god-vessel losses; communication systems failing
- **Miri**: Young learner; protective anxiety high as combat approach visible
- **Sielle**: Widow; continuing practical support; grief steady state
- **God-vessels**: All four weakened equally; communication systems also failing; coordination declining

### Rennik's Terminal Hollowing

**Progression**:
- N01-N15 (GLASS/CRACK/FORGE): Continuous triage; building capacity; no risk
- N16-N20 (SMELT): Overwork visible; Hollowing risk increasing; caring beyond capacity
- N21 (CLEAR/1): Vein-burn fully visible; tremor starting; terminal status obvious
- N22 (CLEAR/2): Hollowing cascade terminal; conviction wavering then gone

**Physical Manifestation**:
- Hands trembling severely (cannot perform precise medical work)
- Vein-burn complete across forearms (scarring deep; tissue damaged)
- Conviction wavering then absent (Wholeness principle becoming inaccessible)
- Energy depleted (body refusing to continue; exhaustion terminal)

**Medical Reality**:
- No treatment available (Hollowing irreversible at terminal stage)
- No cure possible (cascade completed; system failing)
- Death inevitable (timeline: days to weeks; function declining daily)

**Psychological State**:
- Accepts terminal status (has seen others reach this point; recognizes symptoms)
- Works until unable (continues medical function until physically impossible)
- Trains replacement (passes knowledge to Jessa or other available healer; preparation for absence)
- Faces death calmly (professional acceptance; expected consequence of vocation)

**Death**:
- Quiet; not dramatic; body simply ceasing function
- Occurs during sleep (exhaustion so complete that consciousness fails)
- Found by morning (no struggle; no pain; simple cessation)
- Loss immediate and permanent (no replacements available; medical capacity permanently reduced)

### God-Vessel Faction Attrition

**Corlexi Losses**:
- Fortification construction casualties accumulating (Orveth directs more complex structures; more builders dying)
- Xilcore's geometric vision requiring greater precision; precision demanding more cost

**Salee Losses**:
- Forced-healing operations reaching unsustainable casualty rates (Leesa's wielders exhausted)
- Compassion doctrine stretching; compassion becoming harder to sustain under attrition pressure

**Mobel Losses**:
- Purge operations slowing significantly (Lysenne's purgers casualties mounting; efficiency declining)
- Purity doctrine questioned internally (purges not purifying; contamination persisting)

**Eries Losses**:
- Release doctrine believers fewer (Seeri's philosophical position questioned; dissolution doctrine attracting fewer converts)
- Acceptance philosophy strained (continued fighting contradicts acceptance; philosophy incoherent with military reality)

**Mutual Recognition**:
- All four factions acknowledge parallel weakening
- None confident of victory through continued warfare
- Mutual exhaustion understood (all recognize mutual limit)
- Continuation driven by sunk cost (too many dead to quit without resolution)

### Bell-Rope Communication System Failure

**Function**:
- Bell-ropes communicate across Te'Oga territory
- Pattern-based messages: Different rope pulling patterns = different messages
- Reliable system: Connections stable; messages transmitted reliably

**Degradation**:
- Splices fraying (rope connection points deteriorating)
- Messages delayed (transmission times increasing; accuracy declining)
- Ropes breaking (connections severing; messages lost completely)
- Replacement materials scarce (no new quality rope available; repairs inadequate)

**Consequences**:
- Factions less able to coordinate (commanders unaware of other unit movements)
- Resistance communication strained (intelligence takes longer to reach units; coordination difficult)
- Military effectiveness declining (all factions) from communication breakdown
- Accidents increase (units from same faction meet; unclear who controls territory; friendly-fire incidents)

**Beat: Position held → supplies diminish → tactical shift**

**Cycle Pattern**:
1. **Position held**: Unit holds defensive position (requires resources to maintain)
2. **Supplies diminish**: Holding position costs resources; supplies declining
3. **Tactical shift**: Must shift tactics (cannot continue holding position with reduced supplies)

**Example Scenarios**:
- Resistance position holds for 10 days → supplies sufficient for 8 more days → must shift to mobile defense (holding abandoned)
- Corlexi fortification holds line → construction materials depleting → must shift to skeleton crew (geometric complexity reduced)
- Mobel purge operations continue → death squad ammunition depleting → must shift to infiltration tactics (direct assault becoming impossible)

### Stalemate Solidifying

**Explicit Recognition**:
- All factions acknowledge mutual inability to achieve victory
- Continuation recognized as mutual destruction
- No path to favorable resolution visible
- Acceptance growing that stalemate is permanent state

**Paradoxical Continuation**:
- Despite stalemate recognition, fighting continues
- Sunk cost fallacy: Too many dead to quit without resolution
- No exit strategy visible
- Momentum of conflict exceeds rational analysis

### What Ends N22

- Rennik dead (terminal Hollowing cascade; chief medic lost)
- Healing capacity reduced critically (resistance medical support inadequate going forward)
- God-vessel factions weakened (mutual attrition visible; no faction advantaged)
- Stalemate solidified explicitly (mutual recognition of permanent limit)
- Bell-rope communication systems failing (backup systems failing; coordination declining)
- Final provisional measures enacted (contingency plans activated)
- Loyalty tested through loss (resistance members grieve; commitment questioned; cohesion strained)
- Jhace accepts terminal cost (understanding his leadership has consequences for those who follow)
- Position held → supplies diminish → tactical shift beat demonstrated (multiple factions forced to shift tactics)
