## YOUR TASK

Generate a complete Story Bible for the eleventh 15-chapter novella. This novella begins FORGE Turning: all four god-vessels attempt direct recruitment of Jhace. Xilcore wants to correct Jhace's paradox. Leesa claims Jhace as "chosen vessel." Blemo sees Jhace as ultimate contamination. Seeri offers Jhace peaceful death (first of many). Faction lieutenants appointed (Orveth, Thessa, Lysenne, Daric). Ideological opposition formalizes. First god-on-god violence occurs. Inspector Harven dies (collateral).

## NOVELLA SCOPE (N11 ONLY)

### Major Events (IMMUTABLE)
- [ ] Chapter 1-3: All four god-vessels becoming active; attempting recruitment (different approaches)
- [ ] Chapter 4-6: Jhace refuses all four approaches; asserts independence
- [ ] Chapter 7-9: First god-vessel faction lieutenant confrontations (Orveth, Thessa, Lysenne, Daric)

### Character Status at Start (from N10 end)
- **Jhace**: Guilt-driven; protective instinct intense; refusing all god-vessel overtures
- **Marisse**: Dead (absence guides decisions)
- **Tiffani**: Dead (absence guides decisions)
- **Resistance**: ~100-150 members; militarizing further
- **God-vessels**: All four active; attempting recruitment

### The Four Recruitment Attempts

**Xilcore (Form Principle) - Corlexi**
- Approach: Attempts to "correct" Jhace's paradox through Form precision
- Theology: Jhace's dual-principle capacity is flaw; needs perfection
- Method: Geometry-based arguments; precision correction offers
- Jhace's response: Refuses geometrical control

**Leesa (Wholeness Principle) - Salee**
- Approach: Claims Jhace as "chosen vessel for universal integration"
- Theology: Jhace's healing capacity marks him as divine instrument
- Method: Offers inclusion, belonging, universal compassion
- Jhace's response: Refuses forced integration

**Blemo (Purity Principle) - Mobel**
- Approach: Sees Jhace as "ultimate contamination" requiring purging
- Theology: Jhace's paradox is existential contamination; must be cleansed
- Method: Violent purification; assassination attempts
- Jhace's response: Refuses purging; resists violently

**Seeri (Entropy Principle) - Eries**
- Approach: Offers Jhace peaceful death/dissolution
- Theology: All suffering ends in release; accept entropy peacefully
- Method: Gentle offers; no force; respects Jhace's autonomy
- Jhace's response: Refuses death; chooses struggle (foreshadows N28)

### Faction Lieutenants (Appointed This Novella)

- Compassionate coercion; believes she's saving people
- Dies N27 (killed by Jhace)

**Lysenne (Mobel Lieutenant)**
- Oversees purge operations
- Violent; efficient; no mercy
- Dies N24 (killed by Jhace)

**Daric (Eries Lieutenant)**
- Oversees release doctrine spread
- Gentle; accepting; most willing to negotiate
- Dies N28 (chooses self-release peacefully)

### What Ends N11
- All four god-vessels active
- Jhace refuses all four doctrines
- Faction lieutenants established
- First god-on-god violence visible
- Ideological opposition formalized
