**Turning**: CLEAR (4-5)  
**Position**: Twenty-fourth novella  
**Innocence Protocol**: STRICT ENFORCEMENT  
**Previous Bible Links**: N01-N23  

**Lens**: Casualty Report Form (standardized documentation; cause categories; survivor listings; official record-keeping)  
**Motif**: Heat pins (marking systems; careful placement; burn risks on paper; precision marking)  
**Primary Beat**: Faction align → interests diverge → temporary truce broken  
**Beat Bans**: N23's casualty reported/morale shaken/renewed beat; additional ban on testimony archival focus  
**Variance Target**: <20% 5-gram overlap vs. N23/N22

## YOUR TASK

Generate a complete Story Bible for the twenty-fourth 15-chapter novella. Lysenne (Mobel lieutenant) final confrontation with Jhace occurs. Jhace kills Lysenne in self-defense (moral weight accumulates; Jhace has now killed two faction leaders in defense; guilt visible). Mobel faction weakened but not defeated (loses supreme commander; doctrine continues but hierarchy disrupted). All factions converging on single location now visible (convergence dates set; assault now hours/days away). Temporary truces between factions fracturing (alliances designed to fail; interests diverging openly). Final alignments becoming unstable (no faction confident in others). Heat pins marking casualty forms (bureaucratic precision in recording deaths). This novella is CLEAR's final phase: alignments tested; alliances fracture; moral weight of necessary killing visible; final battle imminent.

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS

### What You MUST Present

- Lysenne and Jhace final confrontation (philosophical and physical conflict)
- Jhace kills Lysenne in self-defense (not murder; defensive necessity; but moral weight accumulates)
- Mobel faction weakened from loss of supreme commander (doctrine continues; hierarchy disrupted; efficiency reduced)
- Jhace's guilt visible (has now killed Lysenne [Mobel] and Thessa [Salee] by end of saga; moral burden increasing)
- All factions converging on single location (geographic concentration complete; assembly point reached)
- Convergence dates now set (assault no longer distant; hours to days range)
- Temporary alliances fracturing (factions' interests diverging openly as battle approaches)
- Final alignments becoming unstable (no faction confident in others; temporary cooperation breaking)
- Heat pins marking casualty forms (standardized documentation; careful placement on papers; burn risks visible)
- Casualty report form language throughout (official record-keeping; cause categories; survivor listings)
- Faction align → interests diverge → temporary truce broken beat (multiple examples; cycle visible)
- All events organic to final convergence (no orchestration hints; natural consequence of approaching battle)

### What You MUST NOT Present

- NO hints that Lysenne/Jhace confrontation is orchestrated
- NO foreshadowing of N26+ Battle Royale events
- NO references to N25-N30 or beyond
- NO meta-awareness that alliances are designed to fail
- NO suggestion that Jhace's guilt is part of larger plan
- NO casualty report form language removed from sections 1, 3, 7, 11
- NO guilty canon leakage (Tiffani remains dead; history contingent)

## NOVELLA SCOPE (N24 ONLY)

### Major Events (IMMUTABLE)

- [ ] Chapter 1-3: Lysenne's strategic positioning (Mobel faction supreme commander coordinating final assault preparation)
- [ ] Chapter 4-6: Jhace and Lysenne philosophical confrontation (ideological conflict visible; personal stakes)
- [ ] Chapter 7-9: Physical confrontation escalates (self-defense becomes necessary; Jhace must fight or die)
- [ ] Chapter 10-11: **Jhace kills Lysenne** (defensive strike; killing necessary; but moral weight visible)
- [ ] Chapter 12-13: Temporary alliances fracturing (factions' interests diverging; cooperation breaking)
- [ ] Chapter 14-15: Casualty reports filed (Lysenne documented as killed; heat pins marking forms; final alignment unstable)

### Character Status at Start (from N23 end)

- **Jhace**: Commitment deepened; accepting sacrifice; but guilt accumulating from previous necessary killings
- **Lysenne**: Mobel supreme commander; directing purge operations; ideologically committed; positioned for final confrontation
- **Brighble**: Intelligence tracking alliance status; documenting fracturing cooperation
- **Miri**: Young learner; understanding stakes; next generation visible
- **Sielle**: Widow; continuing support; present in final moment
- **Resistance**: ~30-40 members; positioned for final defense; commitment deepened
- **God-vessels**: All four converged on single location; Lysenne as Mobel leader; other leaders [Xilcore, Leesa, Seeri] also present

### Lysenne Character & Death

**Lysenne Background**:
- Established as Mobel faction supreme commander in N07 (Resonance Awakens)
- Led purge operations throughout entire conflict
- Represents Purity doctrine in physical form
- Ideologically committed to cleansing contamination

**Confrontation Context**:
- Geographic convergence brings Lysenne and Jhace to same location
- Lysenne seeks to recruit/kill Jhace (final opposition to purification)
- Jhace refuses assimilation and cannot flee
- Confrontation becomes inevitable

**Philosophical Conflict**:
- Lysenne: Purity requires cleansing; contamination must be eliminated
- Jhace: Diversity valuable; purification means death; people matter beyond doctrine
- Ideological chasm unbridgeable (no compromise possible)
- Personal stakes: Each represents antithetical worldviews

**Physical Confrontation**:
- Lysenne attacks (initiates violence; Jhace must defend)
- Combat intensifies (both skilled fighters; magic used)
- Jhace initially defending (avoiding killing; seeking disengagement)
- Lysenne pressing attack (not accepting refusal; must eliminate opposition)
- Jhace forced into offensive position (defensive move insufficient)
- Killing becomes necessary (Lysenne won't stop; Jhace dies if he doesn't strike)

**Death**:
- Jhace's defensive strike lands fatally (quick; efficient; but intentional killing)
- Lysenne falls (Mobel supreme commander gone; hierarchy disrupted)
- Jhace witnesses death (faces moral consequence; guilt visible)
- No triumph feeling (necessity recognized but moral weight heavy)

**Significance**:
- Second faction leader Jhace has killed (Thessa was first; N27 kills her also)
- Moral burden accumulates (Jhace didn't want to kill; but necessity forced hand)
- Resistance morale affected (seeing supreme commander fall visible)
- Mobel faction weakened (command structure disrupted; efficiency reduced)

### God-Vessel Alliances Fracturing

**Initial Alliances** (N21-N23):
- Temporary alignment: All four god-vessels against resistance
- United goal: Eliminate common enemy (resistance final stand)
- Cooperation surface-level (mutual interests limited to this moment)

**Diverging Interests** (N24 becomes visible):
- Corlexi: Wants geometric reclamation (perfect order restored)
- Salee: Wants universal integration (all beings merged into Wholeness)
- Mobel: Wants purification (contamination cleansed; only pure remain)
- Eries: Wants release (all choose dissolution; suffering ended)
- These goals incompatible (only one can prevail if any prevails)

**Alliance Fracturing**:
- Corlexi questions Salee's integration (incompatible with geometric order)
- Mobel questions Eries's release philosophy (dissolution contradicts purity)
- Salee and Eries find common ground (both seek transformation of survivors)
- Corlexi isolated (only form doctrine; others seek integration/release)
- Alignment becomes facade (each preparing to fight others after resistance falls)

**Beat: Faction align → interests diverge → temporary truce broken**

**Cycle Examples**:
- Factions align to assault resistance → Lysenne death disrupts Mobel → Mobel interests diverge → temporary truce breaks
- Corlexi and Salee coordinate assault approach → geometric vs integration goals conflict → coordination becomes difficult
- Eries offers release to Mobel fighters → Mobel sees this as competing for converts → rift visible

### Casualty Report Forms & Heat Pins

**Documentation**:
- Lysenne death recorded on casualty report form
- Standardized format (name, date, cause, rank, survivors listed if applicable)
- Heat pins used to mark important sections (precise placement; burn marks visible)
- Official record-keeping (bureaucracy continuing even as civilization breaks)

**Heat Pin Function**:
- Marks cause of death (heat pin placed near cause category)
- Marks rank (heat pin indicating officer status)
- Marks significance (heat pin noting Lysenne's command position)
- Burn marks visible (paper shows heat damage; physical presence of marking)

**Casualty Report Example**:
- Name: Lysenne [Mobel Supreme Commander]
- Date: [N24 Chapter 10-11 approximately]
- Cause: Combat engagement with resistance commander [heat pin placed here]
- Rank: Supreme Commander [heat pin placed here]
- Survivors: Mobel faction continues; new command structure required [heat pin placed here]
- Status: Faction weakened; command disrupted [heat pin placed here]

### What Ends N24

- Lysenne dead (Mobel supreme commander; resistance victory but costly)
- Jhace guilt visible (killed faction leader; moral burden accumulates)
- Mobel faction weakened (command disruption; efficiency reduced)
- All factions converged on single location (final assembly point reached)
- Convergence dates now set (assault hours to days away; imminent)
- Temporary alliances fracturing (diverging interests visible; cooperation breaking)
- Final alignments unstable (no faction confident in others; mutual suspicion)
- Casualty reports filed (Lysenne documented; heat pins mark significance)
- CLEAR Turning approaching climax (next is final CLEAR novella)
- Battle Royale assembly point identified (all factions and resistance at same location)
