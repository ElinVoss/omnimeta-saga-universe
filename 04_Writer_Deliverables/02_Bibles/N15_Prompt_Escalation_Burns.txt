## YOUR TASK

Generate a complete Story Bible for the fifteenth 15-chapter novella. This is the climactic novella of FORGE Turning: the Major Siege. All four god-vessels attack simultaneously. Kylar dies defending resistance position (sacrifices self for evacuation). Jhace holds multi-front defense. Daric spreads release doctrine during siege (psychological warfare). Resistance survives but at catastrophic cost. Jhace approaches breaking point (entering SMELT phase). FORGE Turning ends; SMELT Turning begins (grinding attrition phase).

- [ ] Chapter 1-3: Siege begins (all four god-vessels attacking)
- [ ] Chapter 4-8: Multi-front defense; Jhace coordinating desperate responses
- [ ] Chapter 9-11: Kylar's final stand (holds line; allows evacuation; dies)
- [ ] Chapter 12-13: Daric spreads release doctrine (psychological assault)
- [ ] Chapter 14-15: Resistance holds; siege breaks; victory pyrrhic; FORGE ends; SMELT begins

### Character Status at Start (from N14 end)
- **Jhace**: Fortified positions ready; defensive strategy prepared; determined
- **Kylar**: Lieutenant; young; brave; positioned for heroic death
- **Daric**: Spreading release doctrine; psychological warfare specialist
- **Orveth**: Directing geometric assault
- **Thessa**: Operating forced-healing in assault zones
- **Lysenne**: Leading violent assault
- **Resistance**: ~200+ members; defensively positioned; prepared to hold
- **Brighlee**: Coordinating intelligence during siege

### The Siege Structure (15 Chapters)

**Chapter 1-3: Assault Begins**
- All four god-vessels attack simultaneously
- Resistance positions under extreme pressure
- Initial casualties mounting
- Jhace shifting to full combat mode

**Chapter 4-8: Multi-Front Defense**
- Jhace moving between defensive positions
- Directing resistance response to four-directional assault
- Casualties accumulating
- Ammunition/resources depleting
- Desparation setting in (can they hold?)

**Chapter 9-11: Kylar's Stand**
- Kylar chooses to hold vulnerable position
- Allows main resistance group to evacuate
- Heroic defense (holds against overwhelming numbers)
- Dies defending (overwhelmed; accepts death; completes evacuation)
- Moment of sacrifice becomes symbolic

**Chapter 12-13: Daric's Psychological Warfare**
- Daric spreads release doctrine actively
- Offers death as mercy/escape
- Targets desperate resistance members
- Some defect; most refuse
- Adds psychological pressure to physical assault

**Chapter 14-15: Siege Breaks; Pyrrhic Victory**
- God-vessels cease assault (stalemate recognition)
- Resistance survives but catastrophically weakened
- Kylar dead; many casualties; infrastructure destroyed
- Victory feels like defeat
- Jhace at breaking point (approaches Hollowing cascade risk)
- FORGE Turning officially climaxes
- SMELT Turning begins (grinding attrition phase)

### Kylar's Death (Heroic Sacrifice)
- **Character**: Jhace's lieutenant; young; brave; idealistic
- **Position**: Holds defensive line; allows evacuation
- **Death**: Overwhelmed by assault; chooses to continue defending
- **Significance**: Represents sacrifice pattern; Jhace feels responsible; adds to guilt
- **Legacy**: Others live because Kylar dies; symbolic meaning
- **Foreshadowing**: Death pattern continues through saga (others die protecting others)

### Daric's Psychological Warfare
- **Approach**: Gentle; respecting autonomy; offering release
- **Timing**: During siege (pressure peak; vulnerability peak)
- **Message**: Death is not defeat; release is mercy; struggle is suffering
- **Impact**: Some resistance members accept; most refuse but psychologically affected
- **Characterization**: Daric sees himself as merciful; Jhace sees as predatory
- **Significance**: Foreshadows Daric's N28 self-release (accepts own philosophy)

### Siege Casualty Levels
- **Initial**: ~30-50 immediate casualties from assault opening
- **During**: ~70-100 from sustained warfare
- **Final**: ~120-150 total resistance casualties (reduction from ~200+ to ~50-80 survivors)
- **Proportion**: ~60-75% casualty rate (devastating)
- **Survivors**: Those held defensive positions; those evacuated; core teachers/coordinators

### Infrastructure Destruction
- **Defensive fortifications**: Destroyed/damaged
- **Medical centers**: Overwhelmed; insufficient for casualties
- **Supply systems**: Collapsed
- **Communication systems**: Disrupted
- **Living spaces**: Destroyed (refugees homeless again)
- **Recovery**: Will require SMELT Turning attrition phase efforts

### What Ends N15 (FORGE CLIMAX)
- **Kylar dead** (heroic sacrifice)
- **Jhace at breaking point** (approaching Hollowing risk)
- **~50-80 survivors** from ~200+ resistance
- **Infrastructure destroyed** (recovery needed)
- **Pyrrhic victory** (survived but broken)
- **FORGE Turning officially climaxes** (ideology wars reached peak)
- **SMELT Turning begins** (grinding attrition phase starts)
- **Siege broken but god-vessels remain** (no victory; just survival)

1. **Core Premise** (Major siege; multi-front defense; Kylar's sacrifice; pyrrhic victory; Jhace breaking; FORGE climax; SMELT begins)
2. **Tone & Style** (LAWTEST + siege warfare intensity + approaching breaking point)
3. **Worldframe** (Te'Oga under siege; infrastructure collapsing; survival core focus)
4. **Cast** (Jhace [at breaking point], Kylar [heroic death], Daric [psychological warfare], all four god-vessel leaders [assault commanders], resistance survivors, Brighlee [intelligence during siege])
5. **Magic & Limits** (Four-principle power in direct assault; defensive magic strained; civilian magic use dangerous)

10. **Beats ↔ Scenes Map**
11. **Forbidden Lexicon Gate** (LAWTEST)
12. **LAWTEST Checklist**
13. **Mission Statement** (N15 FORGE climax: siege catastrophic; Kylar sacrifices; Jhace breaking; pyrrhic victory; attrition phase begins; SMELT Turning opens)

- Jhace at defensive limit
- ~200+ resistance members
