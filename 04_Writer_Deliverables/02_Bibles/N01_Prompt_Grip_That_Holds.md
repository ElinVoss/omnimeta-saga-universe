**Turning**: GLASS (1-5)  
**Position**: First novella of saga  
**Innocence Protocol**: STRICT ENFORCEMENT  

---

## YOUR TASK

Generate a complete Story Bible for the first 15-chapter novella of the OmniMeta Saga. This Bible guides prose writing that presents events as **organic, material, and earned**—never foreshadowed, never orchestrated, never predetermined.

---

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS

### What You MUST Present
- The Piercing as a natural catastrophic disaster
- Magic awakening spontaneously from vein-infection post-Piercing
- Jhace discovering dual-principle capacity through accident/instinct
- Tiffani as a skilled mentor with mysterious past (training source: unknown)
- Partnership forming through shared crisis work, vulnerability, competence respect
- Every cost visible (tremor, vein-burn, exhaustion, permanent damage)
- Events that feel grounded in material consequence, not prophecy

### What You MUST NOT Present
- NO timeline hints about Tiffani's true role
- NO meta-awareness of coordinated events
- NO foreshadowing of orchestration or "long con"
- NO references to innocence/guilty framing
- NO hints that any character knows more than they should
- NO destiny language (only choice + consequence)
