## YOUR TASK

Generate a complete Story Bible for the ninth 15-chapter novella. Chloen dies in god-vessel conflict (building collapse). Jhace's second major grief event. The novella demonstrates that teaching cannot prevent loss—even among students. Jessa steps into Chloen's teaching role. Grief becomes normalized state. Hardening continues.

---

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS

### What You MUST Present
- Chloen's death as tragic accident (building collapse from faction warfare, not targeted)
- Building collapse during god-vessel crossfire (uncontrollable circumstances)
- Jhace's grief as deep but less paralyzing (second loss makes him functional through it)
- Jessa stepping into Chloen's role (continuation despite loss)
- Teaching continuing despite casualty
- Jhace hardened but not broken (Chloen death normalizes loss for him)
- Resistance continuing through grief
- All events organic to faction warfare escalation

### What You MUST NOT Present
- NO hints that Chloen's death was orchestrated
- NO foreshadowing of which other students die
- NO suggestion that Jhace could have prevented it
- NO references to future novellas
- NO meta-awareness of loss pattern

## NOVELLA SCOPE (N09 ONLY)

### Major Events (IMMUTABLE)
- [ ] Chapter 1-4: Teaching continuing despite losses; Chloen showing mastery
- [ ] Chapter 5-8: God-vessel factions intensify conflict in city
- [ ] Chapter 9-10: Building collapse during faction crossfire
- [ ] Chapter 11: **Chloen dies** (crushed in collapse)
- [ ] Chapter 12-15: Grief; Jessa steps into role; teaching continues

### Character Status at Start (from N08 end)
- **Jhace**: Accepting cost; hardened; continuing teaching
- **Chloen**: Advanced student; mastery near; about to step into teaching role
- **Jessa**: Junior student; competent; positioned to replace Chloen
- **Rennik**: Chief medic; exhausted but functional
- **God-vessels**: Escalating violence; territorial warfare

### Chloen's Arc (Ch.1-11)
- **Opening**: Teaching sessions; Chloen confident; preparing to teach younger students
- **Ch.1-8**: Mastery improving; positioning for teaching role
- **Ch.9-10**: Building collapse (uncontrollable)
- **Ch.11**: Death (quick; crushed; no prolonged suffering)
- **Ch.12-15**: Absence; teaching continues; Jessa replacement

### What Ends N09
- Chloen dead (second major loss for Jhace)
- Jhace normalized grief (functional despite loss)
- Jessa integrated into teaching (succession established)
- Grief becomes background state (not acute crisis)
- CRACK Turning ending (N10 climax coming)
