## YOUR TASK

Generate a complete Story Bible for the twenty-fifth 15-chapter novella. This is the climactic novella of CLEAR Turning: final preparation before Battle Royale. Mourne (Eries defector; integrated in N18) dies defending civilians (chooses fight over release doctrine; final allegiance to resistance over former faction). All four god-vessels converging on single location (final assembly complete; assault launching within hours). Jhace's resistance holds final position (defensive anchor; cannot retreat; final stand location). Vael continues intelligence work (final reconnaissance; timing of assault confirmed). Final requisition orders distributed (last supplies allocated; distribution schedules final). Four-principle weapons tested (complex Soulpulse techniques rehearsed; efficacy questioned as multi-principle simultaneous casting attempted). Recalibration of Jhace's defensive strategy (testing reveals limitations; plans adjusted). CLEAR Turning officially climaxes; Battle Royale setup complete; assault launches in N26. This novella is transition point: preparation ends; battle begins. All factions assembled. All defenses ready. All doctrines present. Universe balanced on precipice.

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS

### What You MUST Present

- Mourne's death defending civilians (chooses fight over release doctrine; final act rejecting Eries philosophy)
- Mourne positioned with civilians (protection role; evacuation function)
- Mourne death as sacrifice (allows civilian escape; dies fighting; heroic but not deliberate like Torim)
- All four god-vessels converging on single location (final assembly complete; all leaders present)
- Jhace's resistance at final position (defensive anchor; cannot retreat)
- Vael confirming assault timing (final intelligence; assault launching within hours)
- Final requisition orders distributed (last supplies allocated; final distribution)
- Four-principle weapon systems tested (Soulpulse techniques complex; simultaneous multi-principle casting attempted)
- Efficacy questioned (testing reveals limitations; combined doctrines difficult to coordinate)
- Recalibration needed (Jhace adjusts defensive strategy based on test results)
- Ration-board chalk marking (final tallies; accounting marks showing distribution)
- All events organic to final preparation (no orchestration hints; natural culmination of 25-novella buildup)

### What You MUST NOT Present

- NO hints that Mourne's death is orchestrated
- NO foreshadowing of specific N26+ battle events
- NO references to N26-N30 or beyond current phase
- NO meta-awareness that Battle Royale is designed endgame
- NO suggestion that weapon testing reveals predetermined outcome
- NO requisition order language removed from sections 1, 3, 7, 11
- NO guilty canon leakage (Tiffani remains dead; outcome contingent)

## NOVELLA SCOPE (N25 ONLY)

### Major Events (IMMUTABLE)

- [ ] Chapter 1-3: Final preparations visible; all factions assembling; defensive positions finalized
- [ ] Chapter 4-6: Vael confirms assault timing (within hours; final reconnaissance complete)
- [ ] Chapter 7-8: Final requisition orders distributed (last supplies allocated; final distribution schedules set)
- [ ] Chapter 9-10: Four-principle weapons tested (Soulpulse techniques complex; simultaneous casting rehearsed)
- [ ] Chapter 11: **Mourne dies** (defending civilians; chooses fight over release doctrine; evacuation enabled)
- [ ] Chapter 12-13: Efficacy questioned (testing reveals limitations; coordination difficult; combined doctrines problematic)
- [ ] Chapter 14-15: Recalibration of Jhace's strategy (adjusting defensive plan based on test results; CLEAR climax; assault imminent)

### Character Status at Start (from N24 end)

- **Jhace**: At final position; guilt accumulated; commitment unwavering; ready for battle
- **Mourne**: Eries defector; integrated in resistance; protective of civilians; positioned for climactic sacrifice
- **Vael**: Intelligence specialist; tracking assault timing; final reconnaissance
- **Miri**: Young learner; understanding stakes; presence in final position symbolic
- **Sielle**: Widow; continuing support; present as civilian anchor
- **Resistance**: ~30-40 members; all at final position; cannot retreat; will hold or die
- **God-vessels**: All four converged; all leaders present; assault launching hours away

### Mourne Character & Death

**Mourne Background**:
- Integrated as defector in N18 (Erosion's Edge)
- Eries faction member; questioned release doctrine
- Chose resistance over philosophical comfort
- Represented transformation of understanding

**Role in Final Battle**:
- Positioned with civilians (protection responsibility)
- Skilled fighter but choosing protective role over combat
- Teaching others through example (defensive commitment)
- Hope that even defectors find meaning in resistance

**Death Circumstances**:
- God-vessel assault reaching civilian zones
- Mourne holds defensive line (allows civilians evacuation)
- Eries faction approaches (attempting recruitment or capture)
- Mourne face choice: Capitulate or fight
- Chooses fight (rejects release doctrine; affirms resistance commitment)
- Dies defending civilians (overwhelmed; final stand; quick death)

**Philosophical Significance**:
- Final rejection of Eries dissolution philosophy
- Affirmation that resistance values worth dying for
- Demonstrates that defectors' transformation genuine
- Shows that meaning-making worth final sacrifice

### All Four God-Vessels Converged

**Location**:
- Central assembly point (converged from all approaches)
- Leadership present (Xilcore, Leesa, Blemo, Seeri)
- Follower forces assembled (troops, priests, philosophers, healers)
- Doctrine symbols visible (geometric formations, healing tents, purification markers, dissolution temples)

**Visible Assembly**:
- Corlexi geometric fortifications constructed at location
- Salee healing/integration centers established in sectors
- Mobel purge operations staging (now led by new Mobel commander; Lysenne gone)
- Eries dissolution centers present (Seeri's philosophical followers)

**Assault Preparation**:
- Troops positioned for simultaneous assault
- Weapons distributed (various Soulpulse techniques; magic items if any)
- Communication systems prepared (despite failures in N22; some recovery)
- Supply lines established (final push assault configuration)

### Vael's Final Intelligence

**Confirmation**:
- Assault timing confirmed (launches within hours; not days)
- All four factions ready (no delays; no holdups)
- Troop estimates (approximate numbers of attacking forces)
- Leadership positions (where commanders positioned)
- Assault sequence (probable order of attacks; multi-directional assault planned)

**Strategic Value**:
- Allows Jhace final positioning adjustment
- Enables evacuation timing (when must civilians leave)
- Informs tactical response (where to concentrate defense)
- Provides psychological preparation (assault truly imminent)

### Final Requisition Orders & Resource Distribution

**Distribution**:
- Last supplies allocated (final calculation of resources)
- Final distribution schedules set (when supplies distributed; to whom)
- Authority signatures affixed (official allocation; documented for record)
- Ration-board chalk marking (final tallies; accounting marks showing allocation)

**Content**:
- Food rations (final distribution; some shortfall but acceptable)
- Medical supplies (minimal; healing capacity reduced without Rennik)
- Defensive weapons/ammunition (final allocation; strategic distribution)
- Water supplies (secured; essential for final stand)

**Significance**:
- Acknowledgment that supplies may not be needed (final stand implies defeat or victory)
- Distribution assumes casualty replacement impossible (supplies for known forces, not for replacements)
- Final accounting (this is last major resource decision)
- Ration-board chalk showing final tallies (dust patterns show history of allocations)

### Four-Principle Weapon Systems Testing

**What's Being Tested**:
- Soulpulse techniques combining multiple principles
- Simultaneous casting (multiple wielders coordinating same moment)
- Multi-principle effects (combined doctrines creating emergent effects)
- Defensive applications (protecting multiple positions simultaneously)

**Test Results**:
- Success: Some combinations work (coordinated technique produces intended effect)
- Failure: Some combinations fail (principles interfere with each other)
- Limitation: Sustained casting difficult (concentration strain; communication failure; timing issues)
- Recalibration: Need adjustment; planned techniques require modification

**Efficacy Questions Raised**:
- Can technique sustain for battle duration? (Test shows degradation over time)
- Can multiple wielders maintain coordination? (Test shows communication issues)
- Will technique work against four simultaneous god-vessel doctrines? (Unknown; speculation only)
- Is defensive strategy adequate? (Tests suggest limitations; defense may be insufficient)

### Primary Beat: Weapon tested → efficacy questioned → recalibration needed

**Cycle Pattern**:
1. **Weapon tested**: Soulpulse technique tested; multi-principle combination rehearsed
2. **Efficacy questioned**: Testing reveals limitations; technique questioned
3. **Recalibration needed**: Adjustments necessary; technique modified

**Examples**:
- Test: Combined Wholeness/Form principle tested → technique works for 10 minutes then falters → recalibration: Reduce duration of sustained casting; plan for recharge periods
- Test: Simultaneous three-wielder coordination → one wielder loses concentration → recalibration: Reduce to two-wielder combinations; simplify coordination signals
- Test: Multi-principle defensive shield → tested against simulated Mobel purge assault → shield holds but partially → recalibration: Accept partial defense; retreat to fallback positions if needed

### What Ends N25 (CLEAR CLIMAX)

- Mourne dead (defending civilians; rejects release doctrine; sacrifice complete)
- Final requisition orders distributed (last supplies allocated; distribution final)
- Four-principle weapons tested (limitations revealed; efficacy questioned)
- Recalibration complete (defensive strategy adjusted; plans modified)
- Assault timing confirmed (within hours; truly imminent)
- All factions converged on single location (assembly point complete; all present)
- Jhace's resistance at final position (defensive anchor; cannot retreat; will hold or die)
- Vael's final intelligence complete (assault sequence known; leadership positions mapped)
- Ration-board chalk marking final tallies (all supplies allocated; accounting complete)
- CLEAR Turning officially climaxes (preparation ends; battle imminent)
- **Battle Royale setup complete; assault launches in N26; BREAK Turning begins**
