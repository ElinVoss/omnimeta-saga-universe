# GENERATE: N27 Story Bible — "Revelation Unfolds"

**Turning**: BREAK (2-5)  
**Position**: Twenty-seventh novella (battle continues; gods survive through N30 Ch.13)  
**Innocence Protocol**: MAINTAINED  
**Previous Bible Links**: N01-N26-CLEAN  

**Lens**: God-Vessel Doctrine Register (principle statements; follower counts; active operations; theological/operational documentation)  
**Motif**: Doctrine banners (text on cloth; fading patterns; contradictory symbols; deteriorating doctrine visibility)  
**Primary Beat**: Third wave launched → lieutenant casualty → doctrine operational strain → fourth wave  
**Beat Bans**: N26's observation contradiction beat; additional ban on casualty documentation focus  
**Variance Target**: <20% 5-gram overlap vs. N26/N25

## YOUR TASK

Generate a complete Story Bible for the twenty-seventh 15-chapter novella. **Extended battle continues**: Third and fourth assault waves; god-vessels increasing tactical desperation after Orveth loss; coordinated multi-principle strategies escalating. Thessa (Salee lieutenant, NOT a god-vessel leader) dies in tactical combat engagement (Chapter 9 - direct combat; not recruitment; combat-focused encounter with Jhace; material death verified; Soulpulse NULL scanned). Fivefold stasis partially visible (Jhace holding multiple principles; strain approaching but not yet terminal). Witness statements align on some details (multiple observers confirm combat events occurring) but doctrine operational strain contradicts expectations (universe behaving unexpectedly during combat as PHENOMENA ONLY). Doctrine banners fading during combat (text on cloth deteriorating under stress; doctrine visibility diminishing as assault intensity increases). Notation becoming incomplete (battle documentation attempting to capture impossible phenomena; record-keeping challenged). Universe strain reaching critical point but not terminal (paradox phenomena advancing but collapse still ahead; no survival states). **Chapter 15 ends with intensified assault; Leesa continuing direct engagement; gods surviving into N28**. Battle continues unresolved. This novella is BREAK's extended battle escalation: fivefold stasis visible; strain unmaskable; gods surviving despite losses.

### What You MUST Present

- Battle continuing with escalated intensity (third and fourth assault waves; god-vessels increasing tactical pressure)
- **Multiple new tactical maneuvers** (all factions attempting evolved strategies after Orveth loss)
- Thessa's tactical combat engagement (NOT recruitment; combat-focused; combat leadership role)
- Jhace kills Thessa in self-defense during combat (Chapter 9; lieutenant casualty; moral weight visible)
- **Post-Thessa Salee reorganization** (Leesa taking direct tactical command; assault intensity undiminished)
- Fivefold stasis partially visible (all four doctrines + Confluence held; strain approaching but not yet terminal)
- Witness statements aligning on some details (multiple observers confirm combat events)

### Character Status at Start (from N26 end)

- **Jhace**: Multi-principle hold underway; guilt accumulated (one commander killed); capacity strained but holding
- **Thessa**: Salee lieutenant; leading tactical repositioning; positioned for Chapter 9 death
- **Leesa**: Salee faction leader; directing new strategic assault after Thessa loss
- **Xilcore**: Corlexi faction leader; commanding evolved assault tactics
- **Blemo**: Mobel faction leader; continuing purge assault operations with increased pressure
- **Seeri**: Eries faction leader; continuing release philosophy assault with evolved approach
- **Resistance**: ~25-30 members (casualties from N26; holding but strained)
- **Civilian survivors**: If any; witnessing strain manifestations; documentation fragmenting

### Extended Battle Action - Third/Fourth Wave & Escalation

**Third Assault Wave (Ch.1-2)**:
- All four god-vessels launching evolved assault (lessons from Orveth loss applied)
- New tactics visible (Corlexi learning from geometric destruction; Salee trying new flank; Mobel adapting; Eries deepening pressure)
- Resistance defensive lines strained further (casualties mounting; positions held but barely)
- Magic escalating in complexity (multi-principle techniques visible from all sides)

**Salee Tactical Repositioning (Ch.3-4)**:
- Leesa organizing new assault strategy (different tactical approach; attempting to exploit resistance weakness)
- Wholeness doctrine forces repositioning (gaining new tactical advantage through redeployment)
- Resistance forced to spread thinner (holding multiple threatened positions)
- Thessa leading forward combat elements (tactical leadership; combat-focused role visible)

**Corlexi Assault Intensifies (Ch.5-6)**:
- Xilcore commanding evolved tactical approach (applying lessons from Orveth's fate)
- Geometric constructs rebuilt from ruins for assault staging (temporary fortifications)
- Form doctrine applied aggressively (different strategy than Orveth's)
- Pressure increasing on resistance center; multi-directional assault visible

**Thessa's Tactical Combat Engagement (Ch.7-8)**:
- Combat interaction NOT recruitment (Thessa leading assault; direct combat focus)
- Wholeness healing doctrine used offensively (accelerating soldier recovery; maintaining assault momentum)
- Tactical repositioning through combat (Thessa executing coordinated maneuver)
- Jhace recognizing tactical danger (Thessa's maneuver could break resistance line if successful)

**Jhace Kills Thessa (Ch.9)**:
- Combat engagement escalates (Jhace defending against Thessa's tactical assault)
- Fivefold stasis partially visible (multiple principles + Confluence attempted; strain visible but not terminal)
- Thessa wounded during combat (healing doctrine faltering against multi-principle strike)
- Jhace forced to deliver killing blow (tactical necessity; self-defense against coordinated assault)
- Thessa falls (Salee lieutenant gone; tactical maneuver interrupted)
- Material death verified (Thessa's body destroyed; incompatible with life)
- Soulpulse scan on corpse: NULL (no trace, no echo, no residue)
- Doctrine backlash: Wholeness healing dissipates locally; no persistent field remains
- Jhace's guilt visible (second lieutenant killed; pattern emerging; moral burden increasing)

**Salee Reorganization & Assault Continues (Ch.10-11)**:
- Leesa assumes direct tactical command (taking Thessa's assault leader role)
- Desperation assault relaunched (intensified pressure; casualties continue)
- Salee forces consolidating around Leesa (new leadership visible; assault momentum unbroken)
- Assault pressure unabated (no pause for reorganization; assault continues through transition)

**Multi-Principle Warfare Critical Intensity (Ch.12)**:
- Fivefold stasis partially visible (holding 4-5 principles simultaneously; strain approaching but not terminal)
- Paradox phenomena multiplying (all four doctrines + Confluence creating environmental effects)
- Contradiction manifestations visible (Wholeness/Release tension; Form/Purity tension; effects in environment only, no survival states)
- Physics behaving unexpectedly (siege markers shifting unpredictably; causation unclear in phenomenon zones)
- Battle documentation attempting to track impossible phenomena (failing; notation incomplete)

**Witness Statements Aligning; Doctrine Strain Visible (Ch.13-14)**:
- Multiple witnesses documenting Thessa's death (different observers; different accounts)
- Battle documentation showing doctrine operational strain (god-vessel tactics contradicting expected doctrine performance)
- Both observations entered in record (unable to reconcile; contradiction preserved; fog-of-war visible)
- Doctrine banners deteriorating under assault stress (text fading; visibility diminishing; symbol contradictions showing)
- Theological documentation struggling (doctrines fragmenting as assault pressure intensifies)

**Battle Critical Strain, Unresolved (Ch.15)**:
- All factions regrouping; assault relaunching; battle intensifying further
- No breakthrough achieved; no faction retreating
- **Gods alive** (all four faction leaders alive entering N28)
- **Assault momentum unabated** (pressure relentless; resistance holding barely)
- **Resistance casualties severe** (~25-30 down to ~20-25 by chapter end)
- **Fivefold stasis partially holding** (visible but incomplete; strain extreme; terminal approach visible)
- **Universe strain critical but not terminal** (phenomena evident; collapse still ahead)
- **Battle continues into N28** (Thessa dead; other three gods continuing assault; momentum unabated)
