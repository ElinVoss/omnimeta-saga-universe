**Turning**: BREAK (1-5)  
**Position**: Twenty-sixth novella (BREAK Turning opens - Battle Royale begins)  
**Innocence Protocol**: MAINTAINED  
**Previous Bible Links**: N01-N25  

**Lens**: Battle Roster Entry (unit formations; commander assignments; casualty tracking; military documentation)  
**Motif**: Siege markers (territorial maps; position stones; shifting arrangements; geographical tracking)  
**Primary Beat**: First wave launched → commander casualty → reorganization → second wave  
**Beat Bans**: N25's weapon tested/recalibration beat; additional ban on preparation/testing focus  
**Variance Target**: <20% 5-gram overlap vs. N25/N24

## YOUR TASK

Generate a complete Story Bible for the twenty-sixth 15-chapter novella. Battle Royale begins (all four god-vessels + Jhace simultaneous engagement; multi-principle warfare escalates). **EXTENDED COMBAT**: Multiple assault waves; positional warfare; tactical retreats and counterassaults. Orveth (Corlexi geometric commander, NOT a god-vessel leader) dies when his fortress collapses under concentrated multi-principle assault (Chapter 8 - geometric perfection destroyed; Form doctrine tested and found insufficient in combat). **CRITICAL: All four god-vessel leaders survive N26** (Xilcore, Leesa, Blemo, Seeri all alive at chapter 15 end; only Orveth and other lieutenants may die). Post-Orveth, Corlexi faction reorganizes under Xilcore direct command; assault continues with increased tactical desperation. Multi-principle warfare escalates (Soulpulse techniques combining all four doctrines visible; paradoxes emerging as BATTLEFIELD PHENOMENA ONLY, not survival states). Civilian witnesses document (if any survive; testimony fragmented and contradictory). Observations logged that contradict previous battle records (pre-battle assumptions proven wrong; new tactical information). Both conflicting observations entered (battle documentation preserving contradiction). Jhace begins holding multiple principles simultaneously (Confluence capacity tested; fivefold stasis ATTEMPTED but not yet achieved). **Chapter 15 ends with intensified assault pressure unabated; battle unresolved; all four leaders alive and committed; gods surviving into N27**. BREAK Turning opens: multi-principle warfare visible. This novella is transition point: peace ends; battle dominates; action sustains through chapter 15.

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS

### What You MUST Present

- Battle Royale begins (all four god-vessels + Jhace simultaneous engagement)
- **Multiple assault waves** (not single push; escalating series of coordinated attacks)
- **Positional warfare** (territory contested; positions held/lost/retaken; map shifting)
- **Tactical retreats and counterassaults** (resistance executing defensive maneuvers; limited offensive actions)
- Orveth's fortress collapses (Chapter 8 ONLY - geometric perfection destroyed by multi-principle assault; material destruction verified)
- **Orveth dies** (commander casualty; NOT a god-vessel leader)
- **Corlexi reorganization visible** (Xilcore takes direct tactical command; assault relaunched with new commander strategy)
- Multi-principle warfare visible (Soulpulse techniques combining all doctrines; battlefield effects visible)
- Civilian witnesses documenting (if surviving; testimony begins; fragmented)
- Observations contradicting previous records (battle unfolds differently than assumed)
- Both contradictory observations entered (battle documentation preserving conflict)
- Jhace attempting multiple principles (Confluence capacity tested; holds 3-4 principles attempted)
- **Battle sustains unresolved through Chapter 15** (gods surviving; momentum continuing into N27)
- Siege markers tracking territorial changes (position stones shifting frequently; map unstable)
- **NO paradox cages, stasis, sealed-alive, trapped-in-contradiction, liminal survival, echo-persistence** (BANNED)
- **All four god-vessel leaders ALIVE at chapter end** (Xilcore, Leesa, Blemo, Seeri; only Orveth dies)
- All events organic to battle initiation (no orchestration hints; natural consequence of convergence)

### What You MUST NOT Present

- NO god-vessel leaders dead before N30 Chapter 3
- NO paradox survival states (paradoxes are battlefield phenomena only; visualization of chaos, not containment)
- NO stasis, sealed-alive, suspended-in-contradiction, liminal-containment, trapped, limbo, echo-survival, Soulpulse-residue-survival
- NO hints that Battle Royale is orchestrated outcome
- NO foreshadowing of specific god deaths
- NO meta-narrative, Auditor voice, Tiffani mentions, orchestration confession
- NO resolution to battle by Chapter 15 (continues into N27)
- Battle roster language MUST remain (do not remove)

## NOVELLA SCOPE (N26 - 15 CHAPTERS)

### Major Events (IMMUTABLE)

- [ ] Chapter 1-2: Battle Royale begins (all factions engage simultaneously; assault launches from all directions)
- [ ] Chapter 3-4: **First assault wave** (multi-principle magic deployed; positions tested; casualties begin)
- [ ] Chapter 5-6: **Positional warfare** (resistance executing defensive maneuvers; territorial map shifting)
- [ ] Chapter 7: **Orveth's position critical** (fortress construction under assault; geometric perfection strained)
- [ ] Chapter 8: **Orveth's fortress collapses** (geometric perfection destroyed; Form doctrine tested insufficient; commander crushed; material death verified; Soulpulse scanned NULL)
- [ ] Chapter 9-10: **Corlexi reorganization & second wave assault** (Xilcore takes direct command; new tactical approach; assault continues with desperation)
- [ ] Chapter 11-12: **Multi-principle warfare escalating** (Soulpulse techniques combining all doctrines; battlefield paradoxes visible as effects only)
- [ ] Chapter 13-14: **Observations contradicting** (battle unfolds differently than assumed; both contradictions documented)
- [ ] Chapter 15: **Battle unresolved, intensifying** (gods all alive; pressure mounting; assault continuing into N27)

### Character Status at Start (from N25 end)

- **Jhace**: At final position; guilt accumulated; attempting multi-principle techniques; capacity strained but holding
- **Xilcore**: Corlexi faction leader; visible; commanding assault; positioned to take direct tactical command after Orveth
- **Leesa**: Salee faction leader; healing doctrine present; compassion attempting integration assault
- **Blemo**: Mobel faction leader; purge operations continuing
- **Seeri**: Eries faction leader; release doctrine present; dissolution philosophy active
- **Orveth**: Corlexi geometric commander; directing fortress defense; positioned for Chapter 8 casualty (NOT a god-vessel leader)
- **Civilian survivors**: If any; documenting battle; testimony fragmented
- **Resistance**: ~30-40 members; defensive position holding; casualties mounting across 15 chapters

### Extended Battle Action - Multi-Wave Initiation

**First Assault Wave (Ch.1-4)**:
- All four god-vessels attack simultaneously from different directions
- Resistance defensive lines tested (positions hold but barely; casualties begin)
- Magic deployed extensively (Wholeness healing, Form constructions, Purity cleansing, Release dissolution all visible)
- Jhace conducting defensive coordination (commander role visible; multi-principle capacity tested)

**Positional Warfare & Map Shifting (Ch.5-6)**:
- Territory contested; positions held/lost/retaken multiple times
- Siege markers moving frequently (map updated multiple times within chapters)
- Resistance executing tactical retreats (falling back to secondary positions; conserving forces)
- New defensive lines established; terrain used strategically
- Corlexi geometric assault pressing center; Salee healing-forces attacking left flank; Mobel purge forces attacking right; Eries dissolution assault on morale lines

**Orveth's Fortress Under Siege (Ch.7-8)**:
- Multi-principle assault targets Orveth's geometric fortress
- Geometric perfection strained by contradictory principles (Wholeness conflicting with Form; Release conflicting with Purity)
- Fortress integrity compromised; cracks visible in geometric perfection
- Orveth attempts to maintain harmony; loses focus; becomes distracted by coordination failures
- Fortress collapses catastrophically; Orveth crushed; material death verified
- Soulpulse scan on corpse: NULL (no trace, no echo, no residue)
- Doctrine backlash: Geometric harmony dissipates locally; no persistent field remains
- Xilcore observes Orveth's death; assumes direct command immediately; no pause

**Corlexi Reorganization & Second Wave (Ch.9-10)**:
- Xilcore takes direct tactical command (different approach from Orveth's strategy)
- Corlexi geometric doctrine now led by faction leader (increased aggression; desperation tactics visible)
- Fortress ruins become forward assault staging point (temporary constructs for assault coordination)
- Second wave relaunched (intensified pressure; increased casualties on both sides)
- Corlexi forces reorganized around Xilcore's command structure; assault momentum unbroken

**Multi-Principle Warfare Escalating (Ch.11-12)**:
- Soulpulse techniques becoming more complex (combinations tested; new effects emerging as effects only)
- Contradictory principles interacting visibly (Wholeness/Release tension; Form/Purity tension; battlefield effects visible)
- Jhace holding 3-4 principles simultaneously (strain visible; hands trembling; conviction wavering; fivefold not yet achieved)
- Paradoxes multiplying as PHENOMENA ONLY (impossible geometries visible; time seeming to move strangely; causation confusing in specific zones)
- No beings trapped in paradox states; paradoxes are ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS only

**Observations Contradicting (Ch.13-14)**:
- Multiple observers documenting battle (some see Orveth death as Form weakness; others as Confluence power; others as combined assault)
- Battle documentation contradictory (different units report different battle sequences; fog-of-war visible)
- Both contradictions entered in record (documentation preserving conflict; unable to reconcile; battlefield confusion visible)
- Battlefield confusion explicitly diegetic (commanders cannot communicate reliably; reports contradict due to information delay and stress)

**Unresolved Battle Intensifying (Ch.15)**:
- All factions regrouping; assault relaunching; battle intensifying
- No breakthrough achieved; no faction retreating
- **All four god-vessel leaders alive** (Xilcore, Leesa, Blemo, Seeri all commanding; all committed; assault momentum unabated)
- **Assault momentum continuing** (pressure unrelenting; resistance holding but strained)
- **Resistance casualties accumulating** (~30-40 down to ~25-30 by chapter end; losses significant but not catastrophic)
- **Jhace multi-principle hold continuing** (attempted but not yet fivefold stasis; capacity tested but not exceeded)
- **Universe strain visible but not terminal** (paradox phenomena evident; collapse not imminent)
- **Battle continues into N27** (all gods alive; assault momentum unabated; war unresolved)
