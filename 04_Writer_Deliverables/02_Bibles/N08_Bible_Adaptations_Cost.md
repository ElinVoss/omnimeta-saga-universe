**Innocence Protocol**: STRICT ENFORCEMENT  
**Previous Bible Links**: N01-N07

## YOUR TASK

Generate a complete Story Bible for the eighth 15-chapter novella. Marisse dies from Hollowing (terminal cost after decades of Soulpulse use). Jhace witnesses the ultimate price of mastery and accepts that all advancement demands sacrifice. God-vessel factions escalate violence. Rennik becomes chief medic. This novella establishes that there are NO shortcuts—every power costs everything eventually.

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS

### What You MUST Present
- Marisse's Hollowing as natural consequence (decades of Form-use cost accumulation)
- Marisse's death as earned (vein-burn visible at terminal level; body failing)
- Jhace witnessing terminal cost (reinforces his protective intensity)
- God-vessel factions escalating tactics (more violent, more aggressive)
- Civilian casualties mounting from faction violence
- Rennik stepping into medic role (becomes critical to resistance survival)
- Jhace accepting that mastery = inevitable sacrifice
- All events grounded in Soulpulse mechanics (no mystical exceptions)

### What You MUST NOT Present
- NO hints that Marisse's death is orchestrated or foreseen
- NO suggestion that Jhace could have prevented it (learned helplessness)
- NO foreshadowing of N09 deaths
- NO references to future novellas
- NO meta-awareness of sacrifice pattern

## NOVELLA SCOPE (N08 ONLY)

### Major Events (IMMUTABLE)
- [ ] Chapter 1-3: Marisse showing visible Hollowing symptoms (tremor increasing, precision failing)
- [ ] Chapter 4-6: Marisse continues teaching despite degradation; shows cost visibly
- [ ] Chapter 7-9: God-vessel factions escalate violence (tactical shift)
- [ ] Chapter 10-11: Marisse Hollowing cascade begins (irreversible)
- [ ] Chapter 12: **Marisse dies** (Hollowing terminal; body ceases)
- [ ] Chapter 13-15: Jhace accepts cost; Rennik becomes chief medic; resistance continues

### Character Status at Start (from N07 end)
- **Jhace**: Reluctant General; grief-driven; protective intensity high
- **Marisse**: Visible vein-burn terminal; tremor severe; teaching despite degradation
- **Rennik**: Medic; competent; positioned to step into chief role
- **Practitioners**: ~100+ members; militarizing
- **God-vessels**: Escalating violence; territorial claims solidifying

### Marisse's Hollowing (Medical Progression)
- **Opening**: Vein-burn at maximum visible (full forearm scarred); tremor constant
- **Ch.1-5**: Precision failures; teaching increasingly difficult; emotional flatness beginning
- **Ch.6-9**: Hollowing cascade begins; conviction wavering; Soulpulse responses weakening
- **Ch.10-11**: Complete Hollowing; cannot generate conviction; body ceasing function
- **Ch.12**: Death (irreversible; no recovery possible)

### What Ends N08
- Marisse dead (permanent loss)
- Jhace accepts that cost compounds over time
- Rennik established as chief medic (critical role)
- God-vessel factions escalating tactics
- Terminal Hollowing recognized as real limit
- Resistance continues despite loss

## BIBLE SECTIONS REQUIRED

1. **Core Premise** (Terminal cost of mastery; Marisse's death as natural consequence; acceptance)
2. **Tone & Style** (LAWTEST + medical degradation detail)
3. **Worldframe** (Te'Oga in escalating faction war; infrastructure degrading)
4. **Cast** (Jhace [witnessing cost], Marisse [dying], Rennik [stepping up], god-vessels [escalating])
5. **Magic & Limits** (Hollowing mechanics; terminal vein-burn; progression toward death)
6. **Locations & Setpieces** (Teaching sites, medical centers, faction violence zones, Marisse's death location)
7. **Objects & Motifs** (Marisse's terminal vein-burn, tremor at maximum, teaching staff left behind)
8. **Chapter Cadence** (15 chapters; Marisse death Ch.12; beat assignments)
9. **Interlude Specifications** (God-vessel faction escalation from their POV)
10. **Beats ↔ Scenes Map**

## CONTINUITY REQUIREMENTS

**Must maintain from N07:**
- Jhace reluctant general
- ~100+ practitioner resistance
- God-vessel factions escalating
- Rennik already present as medic

**Must establish for N09:**
- Marisse dead (loss echoes through N09)
- Rennik as chief medic (critical for N09)
- Terminal Hollowing recognized
- Jhace accepting sacrifice as inevitable

## OUTCOME

✅ Marisse's death earned (natural consequence)  
✅ Hollowing mechanics grounded (vein-burn limit)  
✅ Terminal cost established (no exceptions)  
✅ Rennik elevated (chief medic role)  
✅ Jhace accepts sacrifice pattern  
✅ Innocence protocol maintained
