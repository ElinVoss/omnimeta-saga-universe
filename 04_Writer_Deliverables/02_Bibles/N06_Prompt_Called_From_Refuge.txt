## YOUR TASK

Generate a complete Story Bible for the sixth 15-chapter novella. This novella begins the CRACK Turning: rebuilding after Fathombreak. Jhace processes Tiffani's death through teaching. Marisse (a former colleague who knew Tiffani) arrives unexpectedly. Resistance network forms organically. God-vessel factions begin forming independently. All events remain grounded in organic emergence—no orchestration hints.

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS

### What You MUST Present
- Post-Fathombreak recovery as chaotic, not guided
- Tiffani's death genuinely driving Jhace's pedagogical mission (grief as motivation)
- Tiffani referenced only as deceased (memory, legacy, loss—never as active character)
- Marisse's appearance as coincidence (she knew Tiffani, comes to honor her memory by continuing teaching work)
- God-vessel factions forming organically (followers attracted to principles, not recruited)
- Resistance network as grassroots (people self-organizing, not orchestrated)
- Jhace processing grief through teaching others
- Magic becoming normalized in post-Fathombreak world

### What You MUST NOT Present
- NO hints that Marisse is orchestrated presence
- NO suggestion that god-vessel factions are coordinated
- NO foreshadowing of Marisse's N08 death
- NO hints about larger patterns or orchestration
- NO references to future novellas
- NO guilty canon language
- NO Tiffani as active character (she is dead; only memories/legacy remain)

## NOVELLA SCOPE (N06 ONLY)

### Major Events (IMMUTABLE)
- [ ] Chapter 1-3: Post-Fathombreak reconstruction; trauma visible; grief pervasive
- [ ] Chapter 4-6: Jhace begins teaching to process grief; first students gathered
- [ ] Chapter 7-8: Marisse arrives (Ch.7); proposes continuing the teaching work in Tiffani's memory
- [ ] Chapter 9-11: Resistance network forming (informal, organic)
- [ ] Chapter 12-15: First hints of god-vessel faction formation (distant reports)

### Character Status at Start (from N05 end)
- **Jhace**: Grief-stricken from Tiffani's death; Confluence wielder; isolated; teaching emerging as coping mechanism
- **Tiffani**: DEAD (died at Fathombreak in N05); present only as memory, legacy, and loss
- **Marisse**: ARRIVES in Ch.7; teaches Form techniques; vein-burn visible (decades of use); knew Tiffani in the past
- **Chloen**: Traumatized survivor; commits to Jhace's teaching continuation
- **Other practitioners**: ~50 people scattered; regrouping slowly
- **God-vessels**: Beginning to manifest powers; followers attracted organically

### Tiffani's Presence (Memory & Legacy Only)
- **Physical Status**: Dead (killed at Fathombreak in N05)
- **Narrative Role**: Jhace's grief motivator; teaching philosophy source; absence felt
- **Acceptable References**: 
  - Jhace remembering Tiffani's teachings
  - Students asking about Tiffani's methods
  - Marisse honoring Tiffani's memory
  - Jhace using techniques Tiffani taught him
  - Grief moments where Jhace wishes Tiffani were present
- **Forbidden References**:
  - Tiffani speaking, teaching, acting, arriving, or doing anything
  - Tiffani as present-tense character
  - Any suggestion Tiffani survived Fathombreak

### What Ends N06
- Informal resistance network ~50-75 members
- Teaching becomes Jhace's central mission (grief processing through pedagogy)
- Marisse established as honoring Tiffani's legacy through continued teaching
- First evidence of god-vessel factions forming (Corlexi, Salee, Mobel, Eries)
- Jhace's four-principle control improving
- Resistance ideology forming (oppose all factions, maintain independence)

## CONTINUITY REQUIREMENTS

**Must maintain from N05:**
- Jhace Confluence wielder (four-principle)
- Tiffani dead at Fathombreak (genuine loss drives all decisions; never returns)

- Chloen traumatized survivor

**Must establish for N07:**
- Marisse integrated as teaching presence (continuing work in Tiffani's memory)
- Resistance network ~75+ members
- God-vessel factions solidifying (not yet conflicting)
