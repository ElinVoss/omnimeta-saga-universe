## YOUR TASK

Generate a complete Story Bible for the twelfth 15-chapter novella. Mass civilian displacement begins from god-vessel purges. Halrick (Mobel refugee) and Mourne (Eries refugee) provide testimony about atrocities. Civilian displacement reaches crisis levels. Mrs. Kettner dies (building collapse—civilian anchor lost). Jhace accepts he cannot save everyone. This novella shifts focus from ideology to humanitarian crisis.

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS

### What You MUST Present
- Purge operations visible and documented (Lysenne's Mobel doctrine)
- Civilian displacement as cascade (refugees without homes; seeking safety)
- Halrick's testimony about purge methodology (credible witness)
- Mourne's testimony about release doctrine (credible witness)
- Mrs. Kettner as civilian anchor (established character, not random)
- Building collapse from god-vessel energy (uncontrollable consequence)
- Jhace accepting helplessness (cannot prevent all casualties)
- Testimony as resistance method (documentation matters)
- All events grounded in faction doctrine implementation

### What You MUST NOT Present
- NO hints that displacement is orchestrated
- NO foreshadowing of specific novella deaths
- NO references to future novellas
- NO meta-awareness of humanitarian manipulation
- NO suggestion that Jhace's helplessness is manufactured
