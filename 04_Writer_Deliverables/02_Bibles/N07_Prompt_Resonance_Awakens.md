# GENERATE: N07 Story Bible — "Resonance Awakens"

**Turning**: CRACK (2-5)  
**Position**: Seventh novella  
**Innocence Protocol**: STRICT ENFORCEMENT  
**Previous Bible Links**: N01-N06

## YOUR TASK

Generate a complete Story Bible for the seventh 15-chapter novella. The CRACK Turning accelerates: god-vessel factions solidify with clear ideologies. Jhace's resistance opposes all four factions. Civilian populations forced to choose sides. Infrastructure becomes a weapon (sabotage begins). Faction wars intensify but remain ideological conflicts—no signs of orchestration yet.

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS

### What You MUST Present
- Four god-vessel factions emerging with distinct ideologies (organic manifestations of principles)
- Xilcore/Corlexi: Form perfectionists (geometric order, precision correction)
- Leesa/Salee: Wholeness healers (universal integration, forced compassion)
- Blemo/Mobel: Purity separatists (cleansing doctrine, purification)
- Seeri/Eries: Entropy philosophers (release doctrine, acceptance of dissolution)
- Civilian populations genuinely choosing sides (not manipulated)
- Jhace's resistance opposes all factions equally (independence focus)
- Infrastructure wars starting (sabotage as factional tactic)

### What You MUST NOT Present
- NO hints that factions are coordinated or orchestrated
- NO foreshadowing of faction leadership or strategy changes
- NO suggestion that civilian choices are manipulated
- NO references to future novella events
- NO meta-awareness of larger saga patterns

## NOVELLA SCOPE (N07 ONLY)

### Major Events (IMMUTABLE)
- [ ] Chapter 1-3: Four god-vessel factions formally solidify
- [ ] Chapter 4-7: Ideological conflicts emerge (competition for followers)
- [ ] Chapter 8-10: Civilian populations forced to choose factions or independence
- [ ] Chapter 11-13: Infrastructure sabotage begins (factions weaponize infrastructure)
- [ ] Chapter 14-15: Jhace opposes all factions; resistance becomes fourth force

### Character Transformations
- **Jhace**: Teacher-Leader → Reluctant General (forced into military role)
- **Marisse**: Teaches doctrine of cost; shows vein-burn degradation
- **Torim**: NEW - becomes brasting specialist (heavy-force Wholeness)
- **Kylar**: Becomes Jhace's lieutenant (coordinating resistance logistics)
- **Faction leaders visible**: Xilcore (Form), Leesa (Wholeness), Blemo (Purity), Seeri (Entropy)

### What Ends N07
- Four factions established with territorial claims
- Ideological conflicts escalating (but not yet violent)
- Infrastructure sabotage ongoing
- Resistance network ~100+ members, militarizing
- Civilian displacement beginning
- Faction lieutenants appointed (foreshadows N11+)
