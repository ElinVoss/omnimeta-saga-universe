# GENERATE: N28 Story Bible — "All Constructs Fall"

**Turning**: BREAK (3-5)  
**Position**: Twenty-eighth novella (battle continues; gods survive through N30 Ch.13)  
**Innocence Protocol**: MAINTAINED  
**Previous Bible Links**: N01-N27-CLEAN  

**Lens**: Philosophical Tract Fragment (combat-adjacent theological debate inside war; diegetic); operational philosophy documentation  
**Motif**: Philosophical tablets (carved text; fragmentation; illegible sections; breaking theology under stress)  
**Primary Beat**: Fifth wave launched → another lieutenant casualty → doctrine questioned → sixth wave  
**Beat Bans**: N27's witness/doctrine strain beat; additional ban on casualty focus  
**Variance Target**: <20% 5-gram overlap vs. N27/N26-CLEAN  

---

## YOUR TASK

Generate a complete Story Bible for the twenty-eighth 15-chapter novella. **Extended battle continues**: Fifth and sixth assault waves; god-vessels desperate after losing two high-ranking subordinates (Orveth, Thessa); all-out assault visible. Daric (Eries lieutenant, NOT a god-vessel leader) engaged in tactical combat (Chapter 10-11, direct combat engagement; not simple philosophy offer; attempting strategic assault on resistance core). Seeri continues assault (does NOT self-release; fighting continues; leader remains engaged). Jhace continues attempting fivefold stasis (holding all four + Confluence; strain visible but not terminal). **Causation breakdown accelerates** (predictions unfulfilled as diegetic battle confusion; multiple causes visible; outcome mechanics unclear in chaos). Philosophical tablets breaking during combat (sacred texts fragmenting under combat stress; doctrine foundations questioned). **Daric dies in combat** (Chapter 11, killed by Jhace in self-defense; third lieutenant casualty; material death verified; Soulpulse NULL scanned). Causation becomes unclear in fog-of-war (actions not producing predictable consequences due to battlefield chaos, not metaphysics). **Chapter 15 ends with universe strain at critical point** (chaos visible; breakdown apparent; but no survival states; no collapse; gods surviving into N29). This novella is BREAK's extended battle philosophy destruction: doctrines questioned through action; sacred texts breaking from stress; causation becoming unclear in war chaos.

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS

### What You MUST Present

- Battle continuing with all-out intensity (fifth and sixth assault waves; god-vessels committing maximum resources)
- **All-out assault visible** (no reserves; final commitment to victory or destruction)
- **Daric's tactical combat engagement** (NOT philosophy offer; direct combat; strategic assault on resistance core)
- Seeri continuing assault (fighting; does NOT self-release; engagement continues)
- Jhace continuing fivefold stasis (holding all four + Confluence; strain extreme but not terminal)
- **Causation breakdown visible** (predictions unfulfilled as diegetic battle confusion; fog-of-war obscures cause-effect)
- Philosophical tablets breaking literally (sacred texts fragmenting; doctrine foundations questioned from combat stress)
- Philosophy questioned (theological contradictions manifesting through combat demands, not metaphysics)
- **Daric dies in combat** (Chapter 11; killed by Jhace; third lieutenant casualty; material death verified; Soulpulse NULL)
- Seeri surviving (only three lieutenants dead; god-vessel leaders continue)
- Multiple causations visible in chaos (fog-of-war visible; causation unclear from battlefield noise, not paradox)
- **Universe strain at critical point** (chaos visible; breakdown apparent; no survival states; no collapse; phenomena only)
- **Battle unresolved; gods surviving into N29** (three lieutenants dead; god-vessel leaders remain; assault unabated)
- Dialogue-heavy sections (theological debate within/around combat; diegetic philosophy-centered narrative)
- All events organic to extended battle (no orchestration hints; natural consequence of attrition)

### What You MUST NOT Present

- NO god-vessel leaders dead (only Daric, a lieutenant)
- NO paradox survival states (phenomena visible as chaos/fog-of-war, not metaphysical)
- NO stasis, sealed-alive, suspended-in-contradiction, liminal-containment, trapped, limbo, echo-survival, Soulpulse-residue-survival
- NO hints of orchestration or meta-narrative
- NO foreshadowing of specific god deaths (N30 Ch.3+ only)
- NO meta/Auditor/Tiffani references
- NO resolution to battle by Chapter 15 (continues into N29)
- Philosophical tract language MUST remain (diegetic; combat-adjacent theology)

## NOVELLA SCOPE (N28 - 15 CHAPTERS)

### Major Events (IMMUTABLE)

- [ ] Chapter 1-2: **Fifth assault wave launches** (god-vessels desperate; two lieutenants already down; all-out commitment visible)
- [ ] Chapter 3-4: **Corlexi all-out assault** (Xilcore committing all remaining forces; no reserves held)
- [ ] Chapter 5-6: **Mobel all-out assault** (Blemo committing all remaining forces; desperation tactics visible)
- [ ] Chapter 7-9: **Eries/Daric tactical engagement** (Seeri directing; Daric leading combat repositioning; strategic assault on resistance core)
- [ ] Chapter 10-11: **Daric dies in combat** (Jhace kills Daric; third lieutenant casualty; material death verified; Soulpulse NULL)
- [ ] Chapter 12: **Causation breakdown visible** (predictions unfulfilled; outcomes contradicting expectations; battlefield confusion explicit)
- [ ] Chapter 13-14: **Philosophical tablets breaking** (sacred texts fragmenting; doctrine questioned; theology documentation struggling)
- [ ] Chapter 15: **Universe strain critical, unresolved** (chaos visible; breakdown apparent; gods alive; assault continues into N29)

### Character Status at Start (from N27 end)

- **Jhace**: Multi-principle hold straining; guilt extreme (two lieutenants killed); fivefold partially visible; strain approaching critical
- **Daric**: Eries lieutenant; leading tactical assault; positioned for Chapter 10-11 death
- **Seeri**: Eries faction leader; commanding assault; surviving into N29
- **Xilcore**: Corlexi faction leader; committing all forces; desperation visible
- **Blemo**: Mobel faction leader; committing all forces; desperation visible
- **Leesa**: Salee faction leader; continuing assault; all four leaders alive and committed
- **Resistance**: ~20-25 members (severe casualties from N26-N27; barely holding)
- **Civilian survivors**: If any; witnessing chaos; documentation failing

### Extended Battle Action - Fifth/Sixth Wave & All-Out

**Fifth Assault Wave Launches (Ch.1-2)**:
- All three remaining god-vessel factions attacking with maximum remaining resources
- Desperation visible (three lieutenants dead; remaining forces consolidating)
- Resistance positions under overwhelming assault (holding but barely; casualties mounting)
- No reserves visible (all god-vessel forces committed; retreat not possible)

**Corlexi All-Out Assault (Ch.3-4)**:
- Xilcore committing all remaining geometric forces (learned from previous losses; applying fully)
- Form doctrine applied maximally (geometric constructs everywhere; precision assault)
- Resistance center position under extreme pressure (Corlexi focusing all forces)

**Mobel All-Out Assault (Ch.5-6)**:
- Blemo committing all remaining purge forces (maximum casualties inflicted)
- Purity doctrine applied desperately (cleansing assault; boundaries enforced violently)
- Resistance flank positions under extreme pressure

**Eries/Daric Tactical Engagement (Ch.7-9)**:
- Seeri directing assault through Daric (Release doctrine deployed tactically)
- Daric leading combat repositioning (NOT simple philosophy offer; direct combat leadership)
- Strategic assault on resistance core (attempting to break central position)
- Tactical brilliance visible (Eries maneuver well-executed; dangerous to resistance)

**Daric Dies in Combat (Ch.10-11)**:
- Combat engagement escalates (Daric leading assault; Jhace defending core position)
- Fivefold stasis partially visible (multiple principles + Confluence attempted; strain visible)
- Causation unclear in combat (Daric's death moment obscured by battle chaos; fog-of-war visible)
- Daric falls (Eries lieutenant gone; tactical maneuver interrupted; third lieutenant casualty)
- Material death verified (Daric's body destroyed; incompatible with life)
- Soulpulse scan on corpse: NULL (no trace, no echo, no residue)
- Doctrine backlash: Release dissolution dissipates locally; no persistent field remains
- Seeri continues assault (does not pause; does not self-release; fighting continues; leader remains alive)
- Jhace's guilt at extreme point (three lieutenants killed; moral burden crushing; pattern visible)

**Causation Breakdown Visible (Ch.12)**:
- Predictions unfulfilled (assault should collapse; instead intensifies; leadership casualties don't break resolve)
- Multiple causes visible (desperation + coordination + doctrine + faith all operating)
- Outcome opposite expected (lieutenants dead; forces weaker; yet tactically more desperate and dangerous)
- Philosophy fragmented (causation becomes unclear in battlefield chaos; fog-of-war explicit)
- Diegetic explanation: Battle confusion, miscommunication, chaos obscure cause-effect relationships

**Philosophical Tablets Breaking (Ch.13-14)**:
- Sacred texts fragmenting literally (not metaphorically; texts breaking from combat stress)
- Doctrine foundations questioned (Release doctrine texts breaking as assault continues despite philosophy)
- Theology documentation becoming illegible (meaning incomprehensible; texts destroy themselves under pressure)
- Philosophy questioned (doctrines physically breaking as contradiction between faith and action manifest)

**Universe Strain Critical, Unresolved (Ch.15)**:
- All three remaining god-vessel factions regrouping; assault relaunching; battle intensifying
- No breakthrough achieved; no faction retreating
- **Gods alive** (Xilcore, Blemo, Seeri alive entering N29)
- **Assault momentum unabated** (pressure relentless; resistance barely holding)
- **Resistance casualties extreme** (~20-25 down to ~15-20 by chapter end)
- **Fivefold stasis partially holding** (visible; strain extreme; terminal approach visible but not reached)
- **Universe strain at critical point** (chaos evident; breakdown visible; no survival states; no collapse)
- **Battle continues into N29** (three gods alive; assault momentum unabated; war unresolved; phenomena as effects only)
