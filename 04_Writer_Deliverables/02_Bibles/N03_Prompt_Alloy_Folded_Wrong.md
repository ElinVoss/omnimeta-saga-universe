**Turning**: GLASS (3-5)  
**Position**: Third novella (escalates to death)  
**Innocence Protocol**: STRICT ENFORCEMENT  
**Previous Bible Links**: N01, N02

## YOUR TASK

Generate a complete Story Bible for the third 15-chapter novella. This is the first novella to feature a **major character death** (Bram). A poisoning crisis emerges, revealing that not all magic use is accidental or well-intentioned. Jhace's protective instincts trigger; Tiffani's strategic thinking deepens. Partnership solidifies through grief.

---

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS

### What You MUST Present
- Poisoning crisis (vein-infection weaponized; first intentional magic misuse)
- Bram's death from poisoning (Chapter 11-12; earned, not arbitrary)
- Jhace's grief response (drives harder training, protective intensity)
- Tiffani's strategic response (begins thinking in terms of defense, not just practice)
- Marisse's ideological opposition to weaponized magic
- Relationship deepens through shared loss (grief-forged commitment)
- Magic abuse as emergent problem (practitioners using Soulpulse to harm)
- Vein-shatter crisis continues declining (becoming manageable)

### What You MUST NOT Present
- NO foreshadowing of Bram's death as orchestrated
- NO hints that poisoning is part of larger plan
- NO revelation of who caused the poisoning (mystery intended)
- NO foreshadowing of N04-N05 events
- NO meta-awareness from characters about larger conflicts coming

**USE N01 + N02 FOUNDATION FILES PLUS:**
- N01_Bible_Grip_That_Holds.md
- N02_Bible_Light_Cracks_Through.md

**CONTINUITY CRITICAL**: Read entire N02 Bible to understand Bram's current status, practitioner movement size, Marisse's emergence, and relationship state

## NOVELLA SCOPE (N03 ONLY)

### Major Events (IMMUTABLE)
- [ ] Chapter 1-3: Poisoning cases emerging (practitioners found with vein-burns inconsistent with known accidents)
- [ ] Chapter 4-7: Investigation begins; Jhace and Tiffani coordinate response
- [ ] Chapter 8-10: Bram exposed to poison source; infection begins
- [ ] Chapter 11-12: Bram dies despite healing attempts (MAJOR DEATH)
- [ ] Chapter 13-15: Grieving; resolution; commitment to defense/teaching

### Character Deaths
- **Bram Torrent**: Dies from poisoning in Chapter 11-12 (first major loss for Jhace; relationship-altering)

### Character Status at Start (from N02 end)
- **Jhace**: Tremor chronic; confident in Wholeness healing; ~50 students
- **Tiffani**: Vein-burn 3.7cm; strategic leadership; ~50 practitioners following her teaching
- **Bram**: Loyal ally; no suspicion of danger coming
- **Marisse**: Ideological leader; opposes weaponization of magic
- **NEW**: Poisoner (identity unknown; antagonist remains hidden)

### Vein-Shatter Timeline (N03)
- Opening: Rupture-grade 4.0-4.5 (crisis mostly resolved; occasional minor shocks)
- Closing: Rupture-grade 3.5-4.0 (approaching baseline; crisis phase ending)

### What Ends N03
- Bram dead (permanent; Jhace grieves)
- Jhace's protective instincts heightened (teaches defense alongside healing)
- Tiffani's strategic thinking evolved (begins thinking in terms of threats)
- Partnership solidified through grief (commitment explicit despite stress)
- Practitioner movement split between Jhace/Tiffani teaching and Marisse's philosophy
- Vein-shatter crisis mostly ended (focus shifts to other problems)
- Poisoning mystery unresolved (no culprit identified; haunts N04-N05)

## BIBLE SECTIONS REQUIRED

Same 13 sections with N03-specific content:
1. Core Premise (first major death; weaponized magic emerges; partnership tested through loss)
2. Tone & Style Constraints (LAWTEST + emotional weight of death)
3. Worldframe (Te'Oga post-crisis; vein-shatter mostly resolved; new threat emerging)
4. Cast (Jhace [grieving], Tiffani [strategic], Bram [until death], Marisse [ideological opposition], Poisoner [mystery])
5. Magic & Limits (Soulpulse weaponization; intentional misuse consequences)
6. Locations & Setpieces (Bram's death location; healing failure; practitioner gathering disrupted)
7. Objects & Motifs (vein-burn progression continuing, tremor worsening with stress/grief, poison traces)
8. Chapter Cadence (15 chapters; Bram death in Ch.11-12; no beat repeats from N01-N02)
9. Interlude Specifications (god-vessel emergence continuing elsewhere; factions not yet named)
10. Beats ↔ Scenes Map
11. Forbidden Lexicon Gate (LAWTEST)
12. LAWTEST Checklist (death costs verified; no resurrection; consequences permanent)
13. Mission Statement (N03's role: death validation, relationship deepening, threat emergence)

## CRITICAL PROHIBITIONS

**DO NOT:**
- Explain who poisoned Bram (keep mystery)
- Foreshadow that poisoning is orchestrated conspiracy
- Hint that Tiffani knew danger was coming
- Reveal god-vessel identities
- Reference events past N03

**DO:**
- Make Bram's death earned (clear cause-effect)
- Show Jhace's grief as authentic (not convenient)
- Show Tiffani's strategic response as leadership, not orchestration
- Keep poisoner identity unknown (mystery carries through)
- Make Marisse's opposition genuine ideological difference

---

## CONTINUITY REQUIREMENTS

**Must maintain from N02:**
- Jhace's tremor baseline
- Tiffani's vein-burn 3.7cm (can increase to 3.9cm)
- Practitioner movement ~50 members
- Marisse as ideological counterforce
- Relationship deepened but tested

**Must establish for N04:**
- Bram permanently dead (no resurrection; haunts Jhace)
- Poisoning mystery unresolved (drives plot in N04)
- Jhace's protective intensity increased
- Tiffani's strategic thinking evolved
- Partnership solid but grief-shadowed
- Practitioner movement split into factions

## OUTCOME

✅ First major character death (earned, not arbitrary)  
✅ Weaponized magic emerges as problem  
✅ Partnership deepened through shared loss  
✅ Mystery unresolved (Bram's poisoner unknown)  
✅ Innocence protocol maintained  
✅ Sets up N04 faction conflicts
