# OmniMeta Saga Universe — Git Repository

**Version**: 3.0  
**Created**: October 31, 2025  
**Updated**: November 1, 2025  
**Purpose**: Complete knowledge base for the 30-novella OmniMeta Saga  
**Usage**: Foundation for generating novella-specific Story Bibles and prose  

---

## OVERVIEW

This repository contains all foundational knowledge, character documentation, and structural timelines for the **OmniMeta Saga** — a 30-novella science-fantasy epic spanning six Turnings with a hidden acrostic structure.

### The Hidden Acrostic

The first letter of each novella title in a turning spells a word representing the metalworking metaphor at the heart of the saga:

**GLASS** (N1-N5) → **CRACK** (N6-N10) → **FORGE** (N11-N15) → **SMELT** (N16-N20) → **CLEAR** (N21-N25) → **BREAK** (N26-N30)

This represents the process of forging Jhace as a weapon through orchestrated catastrophe.

---

## THE ACROSTIC STRUCTURE

- N01: **G**rip That Holds
- N02: **L**ight Cracks Through
- N03: **A**lloy Folded Wrong
- N04: **S**hatter From Heat
- N05: **S**teal Breaks Open

**Metaphor**: Fragile, transparent, newly formed (Soulpulse awakens, world is brittle)

### CRACK (N6-N10) — The Second Turning
- N06: **C**ontrol Spreads Wide
- N07: **R**uins Form Five
- N08: **A**sh and Hunger
- N09: **C**oalition Rises

- N12: **O**pen the Anvil
- N13: **R**eckon with Divine
- N14: **G**rind Steel Sharp
- N15: **E**ach Faction Burns

**Metaphor**: Heat and hammering, shaping through violence (god wars, Jhace forged as weapon)

### SMELT (N16-N20) — The Fourth Turning
- N16: **S**lowly Mend
- N17: **M**elted Collateral
- N18: **E**mbered Defectors
- N19: **L**ast Before Breaking
- N20: **T**empering in Battle

**Metaphor**: Melting down, refining through extreme heat (attrition, casualties mount)

### CLEAR (N21-N25) — The Fifth Turning
- N21: **C**onfluence Hunted
- N22: **L**ink the Gods
- N23: **E**dge All Weapons
- N24: **A**ssault Begins
- N25: **R**esist and Hold

**Metaphor**: Purified, transparent, ready for final use (final preparation, convergence)

### BREAK (N26-N30) — The Sixth Turning
- N26: **B**anners Split Apart
- N27: **R**emembered Ghosts
- N28: **E**verything Melts
- N29: **A**sh and Quenching
- N30: **K**eeping the Silence

**Metaphor**: Shattering, collapse, revelation (battle royale, universe breaks, truth revealed)

## BIBLE PLACEHOLDER-PROMPT SYSTEM

### What Are Bible Placeholders?

Each of the 30 Bible files (`N01_Bible_Grip_That_Holds.md` through `N30_Bible_Keeping_the_Silence.md`) currently contains a **placeholder-prompt** rather than a completed Story Bible.

**The placeholder IS the prompt.** When you open a Bible file, you'll find:

1. **CAPS innocence protocol reminder** (prevents guilty canon foreshadowing)
2. **Direct GitHub raw links** to ALL previous completed Bibles (for continuity)
3. **Story-specific requirements** (major events, deaths, character arcs from timeline)
4. **13-section Bible structure** to generate
5. **Git push instructions** (how to replace placeholder with completed Bible)
6. **Quality checklist** (verification before pushing)

### Progressive Linking System

Each Bible placeholder links to ALL previous completed Bibles:

- **N01**: 0 previous links (establishes baselines)
- **N02**: 1 previous link (N01)
- **N03**: 2 previous links (N01, N02)
- **N15**: 14 previous links (N01-N14)
- **N30**: 29 previous links (N01-N29)

This ensures **continuity chains** — each Bible builds on everything before it.

### How to Generate a Bible

**Quick Start**:
1. Open the Bible placeholder file (e.g., `N01_Bible_Grip_That_Holds.md`)
2. Read the embedded prompt
3. Follow the instructions to generate all 13 sections
4. Overwrite the placeholder file with the completed Bible
5. Push to GitHub using the provided Git commands

**See**: `QUICKSTART_BIBLE_GENERATION.md` for immediate action guide  
**See**: `docs/BIBLE_GENERATION_WORKFLOW.md` for complete documentation

## KEY CONCEPTS

### Dual-Canon Architecture

The saga operates on two narrative layers:

**INNOCENT FRAME** (N1–N29):
- What characters experience
- Crises appear organic
- Tiffani is genuine partner who dies in N5
- Jhace is survivor forced into mastery
- Gods awaken naturally during Fathombreak

**GUILTY FRAME** (N30 revelation):
- What the Auditor orchestrated
- Crises were engineered
- Tiffani is extradimensional observer who staged death
- Jhace was forged as weapon
- Gods were awakened deliberately

**Writer GPTs only access INNOCENT FRAME** (except N30 GPT, which requires guilty truth).

---

### Beat Unpredictability System

Narrative structure varies unpredictably across all novellas:
- 30+ beat methods in repertoire
- No consecutive repeats
- No rotation patterns
- No sequence repeats
- Readers cannot predict delivery method, only content escalation

---

### Soulpulse Magic System

**Principles**:
- Wholeness (integration, healing, organic connection)
- Form (geometry, structure, perfection)
- Purity (separation, cleansing, isolation)
- Entropy (dissolution, release, acceptance)

**Jhace's Progression**:
- N1: Wholeness (instinctive)
- N2: Dual-principle (Wholeness + Form)
- N5: Four-principle simultaneity (Confluence weapon)
- N29: Fivefold stasis (all four + Confluence)

**Cost**:
- Immediate: Tremor, exhaustion
- Cumulative: Vein-burn (visible scarring)
- Terminal: Hollowing (neurological collapse)

---

### God-Vessels

Four mortals transformed into divine embodiments during Fathombreak (N5):
- **Xilcore/Corlexi** (Form) — Perfection through geometric correction
- **Leesa/Salee** (Wholeness) — Compassion through forced integration
- **Blemo/Mobel** (Purity) — Cleansing through purge operations
- **Seeri/Eries** (Entropy) — Peace through acceptance of dissolution

Each builds faction, spreads doctrine, escalates toward Battle Royale (N26–N29).

## USAGE GUIDE

### For Bible Generation (Primary Workflow)

1. **Open** the Bible placeholder file for the novella you want to generate (e.g., `04_Writer_Deliverables/02_Bibles/N01_Bible_Grip_That_Holds.md`)
2. **Read** the entire embedded prompt
3. **Click** all GitHub raw links to fetch foundation files and previous Bibles
4. **Generate** all 13 sections of the Story Bible following the structure
5. **Verify** against the quality checklist (no guilty canon, continuity maintained, etc.)
6. **Overwrite** the placeholder file with your completed Bible
7. **Push** to GitHub using the provided Git commands
8. **Move to next novella** (N02 will now be able to link to completed N01)

**See**: `QUICKSTART_BIBLE_GENERATION.md` for step-by-step instructions

### For Custom GPT Configuration

1. **Receive** novella bible + prose engine prompt from Perplexity Space
2. **Configure** Custom GPT with:
   - System prompt = Prose engine prompt
   - Knowledge files = Foundation files + character dossiers + novella bible
3. **Write** prose chapter-by-chapter
4. **Share** completed chapters back to Perplexity Space for consistency validation

### For Manual Reference

All files are human-readable Markdown. Query any file directly for:
- Canon questions → `01_Foundation/01_Canon/`
- Character status → `02_Character_Dossiers/` or `03_Structural_Timelines/03_Character_Arc_Tracker.md`
- Plot events → `03_Structural_Timelines/01_Progression_Timeline_Master.md`
- Crisis timeline → `03_Structural_Timelines/04_Crisis_Escalation_Map.md`

---

## INNOCENCE PROTOCOL

**Critical**: Writer GPTs must NOT access guilty-frame files (except N30).

**Innocent-frame files** (safe for all Writer GPTs):
- All `01_Foundation/` files
- All `02_Character_Dossiers/INNOCENT_FRAME/` files
- All `03_Structural_Timelines/` files (contain both frames but clearly labeled)

**Guilty-frame files** (N30 ONLY):
- `02_Character_Dossiers/GUILTY_FRAME/` files
- Orchestration truth in structural timelines (clearly marked)

**Enforcement**: 
- Each Bible placeholder contains CAPS reminder about innocence protocol
- Links only point to innocent-frame files (except N30)
- Quality checklist verifies no guilty canon foreshadowing

---

## CONTINUITY CONSTRAINTS

All novellas must honor:
- **Deaths are permanent** (except Tiffani's staged death in N5)
- **Physical degradation accumulates** (Jhace's hands, Tiffani's vein-burn)
- **Soulpulse capacity only increases** (never decreases or resets)
- **Relationships evolve** (cannot regress without cause)
- **World-state changes persist** (infrastructure doesn't magically repair)

Track continuity via:
- `03_Structural_Timelines/03_Character_Arc_Tracker.md` (who's alive, who's dead)
- `03_Structural_Timelines/05_Soulpulse_Capacity_Progression.md` (Jhace's power level)
- Previous novella bibles (immutable facts from earlier books)

**The Bible placeholder system enforces this** — each placeholder links to all previous Bibles and requires reading them before generating the next one.
