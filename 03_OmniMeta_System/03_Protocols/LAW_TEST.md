- [ ] **No Earth references** — No real-world locations, cultures, religions

- [ ] **Continuity honored** — Deaths permanent, physical states consistent
- [ ] **Soulpulse mechanics accurate** — Matches `Soulpulse_Core_v2.md`

### ✅ Prose Quality

## FAILURE MODES

If any checklist item fails:

**STOP** → **FIX** → **RE-RUN LAW_TEST** → **PROCEED**

Do not publish prose that fails LAW_TEST. The integrity of the saga depends on these constraints.

## USAGE EXAMPLE

```bash
# Before publishing Chapter 3 of N1:
1. Read chapter prose
2. Run through LAW_TEST checklist
3. If all items pass → Approve for publication
4. If any fail → Revise prose, re-run LAW_TEST
```
