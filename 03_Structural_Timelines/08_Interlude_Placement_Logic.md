# INTERLUDE PLACEMENT LOGIC

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Created**: October 31, 2025  
**Purpose**: Define interlude placement rules and build-up/break-down methodology  
**Usage**: Reference for Perplexity Space when determining interlude positioning in novella bibles  

---

## INTERLUDE OVERVIEW

**Interludes** are god-vessel POV chapters (800 words each) that provide glimpses into faction activities. Each novella contains **2 interludes** featuring **2 different god-vessels**.

**Purpose**:
- Show god-vessel perspective (doctrine, followers, operations)
- Provide horror/surveillance contrast to Jhace's heroic struggle
- Build world beyond Jhace's immediate awareness
- Create unpredictability (readers cannot predict when interludes occur)

---

## PLACEMENT VARIATION

Interludes vary placement across novellas to prevent predictability:

**N1**: After Ch.3, After Ch.11  
**N2**: After Ch.4, After Ch.12  
**N3**: After Ch.5, After Ch.10  
**N4**: After Ch.2, After Ch.14  
**N5**: After Ch.11 (only one, Auditor Epilogue absorbs second)  

**Pattern**: Early/mid, mid/late, early/late, very early/very late, late only

**Principle**: Never place interludes at same chapter positions across consecutive novellas.

---

## BUILD-UP VS. BREAK-DOWN

Each interlude uses either **build-up** (pre-crisis setup) or **break-down** (post-crisis consequences), never both in same novella.

### Build-Up Methodology
**Definition**: A-plot events before interlude setup what interlude reveals.

**Example**:
- **A-plot (Ch.4)**: Jhace notices dome scars, geometric patterns appearing
- **Interlude 1A (after Ch.4)**: Xilcore's perspective — obsessive geometric "corrections"
- **Effect**: Reader understands what Jhace witnessed

**Usage**: When god-vessel activity is mysterious, interlude explains

---

### Break-Down Methodology
**Definition**: Interlude explains what A-plot characters witness after.

**Example**:
- **Interlude 2A (after Ch.11)**: Blemo's purge operations shown
- **A-plot (Ch.12)**: Refugees (Halrick) describe fires and purges
- **Effect**: Reader knows truth before A-plot characters do

**Usage**: When god-vessel activity has consequences, interlude provides context

## INTERLUDE ROTATION ACROSS NOVELLAS

### N1 (GLASS)
- **Interlude 1A** (after Ch.3): Xilcore/Corlexi (Form) — Build-up
- **Interlude 1B** (after Ch.3): Leesa/Salee (Wholeness) — Build-up
- **Interlude 2A** (after Ch.11): Blemo/Mobel (Purity) — Break-down
- **Interlude 2B** (after Ch.11): Seeri/Eries (Entropy) — Break-down

### N2 (GLASS)
- **Interlude 1A** (after Ch.4): Xilcore escalation — Build-up
- **Interlude 2A** (after Ch.12): Blemo arrival — Break-down

### N3 (GLASS)
- **Interlude 1B** (after Ch.5): Leesa binding — Break-down
- **Interlude 2B** (after Ch.10): Seeri collapses — Build-up

### N4 (GLASS)
- **Interlude 2A** (after Ch.2): Blemo purges — Build-up
- **Interlude 1A** (after Ch.14): Xilcore corrections — Break-down

### N5 (GLASS)
- **Interlude 2A** (after Ch.11): Leesa clarity — Build-up
- **Interlude 2B** (after Ch.11): Seeri mercy — Build-up
- **Auditor Epilogue** (end): Tiffani's perspective (replaces second interlude pair)

---

## INTERLUDE CONTENT GUIDELINES

### God-Vessel POV Requirements
- **800 words** per interlude (strict)
- **Third-person limited** (god-vessel's perspective)
- **Doctrine demonstration** (show principle in action)
- **Follower interactions** (lieutenants, converts, victims)
- **Horror/surveillance tone** (clinical detachment, monstrosity)
- **No Jhace awareness** (god-vessels don't know they're being forged)

### Auditor Epilogue (N5 only)
- **1,200 words** (replaces second interlude pair)
- **Tiffani's perspective** (hidden observation post-staged death)
- **Orchestration hints** (Jhace curves off chart, unaccounted-for anchor)
- **Counter-Spark mission** (testing reality's self-awareness capacity)
- **Guilty canon only** (never shared with Writer GPTs until N30)

## PLACEMENT DECISION TREE

When generating novella bible, determine interlude placement:

1. **Review last novella's placement** (prevent consecutive patterns)
2. **Identify crisis points** (where interludes could build-up or break-down)
3. **Select placement chapters** (vary from previous novellas)
4. **Choose methodology** (build-up or break-down, not both)
5. **Assign god-vessels** (rotate through all four across novellas)
6. **Record placement** (update tracking for next novella)

---

## EXAMPLES

### Build-Up Example (N1 Interlude 1A)
**A-plot Setup (Ch.1-3)**:
- Jhace notices dome scars appearing
- Geometric patterns spreading across buildings
- No explanation provided

**Interlude 1A (after Ch.3): Xilcore's Perspective**:
- Shows Xilcore "correcting" imperfect structures
- Followers report new "corrections" needed
- Doctrine: "Perfection demands sacrifice"

**Effect**: Reader understands what Jhace witnessed (build-up)

---

### Break-Down Example (N1 Interlude 2A)
**Interlude 2A (after Ch.11): Blemo's Perspective**:
- Shows Mobel purge operations
- Followers burn "contaminated" districts
- Doctrine: "Purity requires cleansing"

**A-plot Consequence (Ch.12)**:
- Refugees (Halrick) arrive, describe fires
- Jhace hears testimony about purges
- Realizes god-vessel factions are escalating

**Effect**: Reader knows truth before Jhace (break-down)

---

## UNPREDICTABILITY ENFORCEMENT

**Constraints**:
- No consecutive novellas place interludes at same chapters
- Build-up/break-down alternates across novellas (not both in one)
- God-vessel rotation ensures all four appear across Turning
- Placement varies: early, mid, late, very early, very late

**Result**: Readers cannot predict when interludes will occur, maintaining tension.
