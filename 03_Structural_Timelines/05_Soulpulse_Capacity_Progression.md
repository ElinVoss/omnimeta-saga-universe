## PROGRESSION OVERVIEW

Jhace's Soulpulse capacity evolves from **instinctive Wholeness** (N1) to **fivefold stasis** (N29), with each advancement earned through crisis, loss, or teaching.

**Key Milestones**:
- **N1**: Wholeness awakens (instinctive)
- **N2**: Dual-principle competence (Wholeness + Form)
- **N5**: Four-principle simultaneity (Confluence weapon)
- **N7**: Form mastery
- **N12**: Purity mastery
- **N29**: Fivefold stasis (all four + Confluence)

## DETAILED PROGRESSION

### N1: Wholeness Awakens
**Capacity**: Wholeness-pattern (primary), Form-pattern (learning)  
**Trigger**: The Piercing (vein-infection activates latent magic)  
**First Use**: Instinctive healing of injured child (Ch.3)  
**Teaching**: Tiffani teaches velding basics (guide, don't force)  
**Cost**: Tremor, exhaustion, hands callused  
**Limitations**: Cannot sustain long use, high metabolic cost  

---

### N2: Dual-Principle Competence
**Capacity**: Wholeness + Form simultaneously  
**Trigger**: Stress-riser crisis requires both principles  
**Advancement**: Learns sustainable pacing from Tiffani  
**Teaching**: Teaches Chloen and others basic velding  
**Cost**: Tremor worsens, vein-burn begins (minimal)  
**Limitations**: Cannot use for extended periods without rest  

---

### N3: Wholeness Limits Discovered
**Capacity**: Same as N2, but limits revealed  
**Trigger**: Bram's poisoning — Jhace cannot save him  
**Advancement**: Learns Wholeness cannot heal everything (toxins, advanced disease)  
**Teaching**: Teaches cost awareness to apprentices  
**Cost**: Guilt, psychological burden  
**Limitations**: Healing has limits; cannot reverse death  

---

### N4: Self-Healing Unlocked
**Capacity**: Wholeness self-application (healing own body)  
**Trigger**: Hollowing crisis — Tiffani saves Jhace, he learns technique  
**Advancement**: Can heal own neurological damage (limited)  
**Teaching**: Does not teach this (too dangerous for apprentices)  
**Cost**: High metabolic cost, requires extended rest  
**Limitations**: Cannot prevent cumulative vein-burn  

---

### N5: Four-Principle Simultaneity (Confluence)
**Capacity**: Wholeness + Form + Purity + Entropy simultaneously  
**Trigger**: Steal Breaks Open — grief-driven involuntary explosion  
**Advancement**: Becomes Confluence weapon (can hold all four principles at once)  
**Teaching**: Cannot teach this (unique to Jhace)  
**Cost**: Hands scarred, vein-burn accelerates, terminal trajectory begins  
**Limitations**: Sustained use will kill him (Hollowing inevitable)  

---

### N6: Post-Steal Breaks Open Control
**Capacity**: Four-principle control improving  
**Trigger**: Marisse teaches advanced Form techniques  
**Advancement**: Can use four principles intentionally (not just involuntarily)  
**Teaching**: Teaches three-principle combinations to advanced students  
**Cost**: Chronic tremor, hands bleeding intermittently  
**Limitations**: Cannot sustain fivefold (Confluence + all four) yet  

---

### N7: Form Mastery
**Capacity**: Form-pattern mastery (geometric perfection)  
**Trigger**: Marisse's teaching (N6–N7)  
**Advancement**: Can create perfect geometric locks (infrastructure stabilization)  
**Teaching**: Teaches Form mastery to Jessa and others  
**Cost**: Vein-burn spreading from hands to forearms  
**Limitations**: Form alone cannot solve ideological conflicts  

---

### N8–N11: Sustained Four-Principle Use
**Capacity**: Four-principle simultaneity sustainable (limited duration)  
**Trigger**: God-vessel confrontations require all four principles  
**Advancement**: Can hold four principles for hours (not days)  
**Teaching**: Teaches sustainable use to resistance network  
**Cost**: Hands bleeding regularly, exhaustion chronic  
**Limitations**: Cannot hold indefinitely without collapse  

---

### N12: Purity Mastery
**Capacity**: Purity-pattern mastery (cleansing, separation)  
**Trigger**: Countering Mobel faction's purge operations  
**Advancement**: Can cleanse contamination without destroying host  
**Teaching**: Teaches Purity basics (dangerous, limited students)  
**Cost**: Vein-burn reaches elbows  
**Limitations**: Purity mastery does not prevent ideological spread  

---

### N13–N20: Four-Principle Endurance
**Capacity**: Four-principle use for extended periods (days)  
**Trigger**: Siege and attrition warfare require sustained defense  
**Advancement**: Can hold four principles during multi-day battles  
**Teaching**: Teaches endurance techniques to resistance  
**Cost**: Hands bleeding continuously, approaching Hollowing threshold  
**Limitations**: Terminal cost accumulating, death inevitable  

---

### N21–N25: Preparing for Fivefold
**Capacity**: Four-principle mastery complete, preparing for fivefold  
**Trigger**: Realizes only fivefold stasis can stop god-vessels  
**Advancement**: Mental preparation for terminal cost  
**Teaching**: Passes all knowledge to Vael, Selwin, Miri (legacy building)  
**Cost**: Near Hollowing, hands bleeding constantly  
**Limitations**: Fivefold will be terminal (knows this, accepts it)  

---

### N26–N28: Fivefold Attempts
**Capacity**: Attempting fivefold stasis (all four + Confluence)  
**Trigger**: Battle Royale — all four god-vessels attacking  
**Advancement**: Can hold fivefold briefly (seconds, then minutes)  
**Teaching**: No longer teaching (focused on survival)  
**Cost**: Hands destroyed, bleeding profusely, terminal  
**Limitations**: Cannot sustain fivefold long enough yet  

---

### N29: Fivefold Stasis Achieved
**Capacity**: **Fivefold stasis** — Wholeness + Form + Purity + Entropy + Confluence simultaneously  
**Trigger**: Final confrontation, all four god-vessels trapped  
**Advancement**: Becomes living hinge — universe balanced on his will  
**Teaching**: None (holding stasis)  
**Cost**: **Terminal** — hands bleeding continuously, Hollowing imminent, death certain  
**Limitations**: Cannot release stasis without universe collapsing  

**Description**: Jhace holds all four god-vessels in paradox. Each principle opposes the others:
- **Wholeness** (integration) vs. **Purity** (separation)
- **Form** (perfection) vs. **Entropy** (dissolution)
- **Confluence** (paradox) holds the contradiction stable

Jhace becomes the paradox itself — the only thing preventing mutual annihilation.

---

### N30: Stasis Collapse
**Capacity**: Fivefold stasis held until revelation  
**Trigger**: Tiffani's return, orchestration confession  
**Advancement**: None (universe collapses)  
**Teaching**: None  
**Cost**: Universe ceases  
**Limitations**: Paradox becomes self-aware, reality cannot sustain

## COST ACCUMULATION

### Physical Degradation Timeline
- **N1**: Hands callused, first tremors
- **N2**: Tremor worsens, minimal vein-burn
- **N3**: Guilt (psychological cost)
- **N4**: Vein-burn visible (hands)
- **N5**: Hands scarred, vein-burn accelerates
- **N7**: Vein-burn spreads to forearms
- **N10**: Chronic tremor, exhaustion visible
- **N12**: Vein-burn reaches elbows
- **N15**: Hands bleeding intermittently
- **N20**: Hands bleeding regularly, near Hollowing
- **N25**: Hands bleeding constantly, terminal threshold
- **N29**: Hands destroyed, bleeding profusely, terminal

### Metabolic Cost
- **N1–N5**: Requires rest and food after use
- **N6–N10**: Chronic exhaustion, requires frequent rest
- **N11–N20**: Exhaustion constant, food cannot compensate
- **N21–N29**: Terminal metabolic collapse, death inevitable

---

## TEACHING PROGRESSION

Jhace's teaching evolves as his capacity grows:

- **N1**: Teaches Chloen vein-sensing basics
- **N2**: Teaches multiple apprentices velding
- **N6**: Teaches advanced techniques (dual-principle)
- **N7**: Teaches Form mastery
- **N12**: Teaches Purity basics (limited students)
- **N20**: Teaches endurance techniques
- **N25**: Passes all knowledge to successors (legacy building)

---

## UNIQUE ASPECTS

### Why Jhace Can Hold Fivefold
1. **Grief-Forged**: Steal Breaks Open unlocked four-principle capacity through trauma
2. **Teaching Practice**: Teaching others deepened his understanding
3. **Cost Acceptance**: Willingness to die enables terminal techniques
4. **Paradox Embodiment**: Jhace himself is paradox (loves and grieves simultaneously)

### Why Others Cannot
- **Tiffani**: Dual-principle capable, but not four (and orchestrator, not weapon)
- **God-Vessels**: Single-principle embodiments, cannot hold opposites
- **Apprentices**: Lack grief-forging and terminal cost acceptance
