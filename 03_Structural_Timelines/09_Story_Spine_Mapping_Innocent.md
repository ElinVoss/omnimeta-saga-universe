# Story Spine Mapping (Innocent Frame)

**Version**: 1.0  
**Created**: November 1, 2025  
**Purpose**: Civic-ledger spine for continuity tracking across all 30 novellas  
**Frame**: Innocent only (no guilty canon orchestration)

---

## OVERVIEW

This document tracks the **immutable story spine** — the core events, character states, and world changes that form the continuity backbone of the OmniMeta Saga. Each entry is a **civic-ledger fact** that MUST be honored by all subsequent novellas.

**Civic-Ledger Rules**:
- Once an event occurs, it cannot be retconned
- Once a character dies, they stay dead (except Tiffani's staged death in N5)
- Once physical degradation occurs, it accumulates (never reverses)
- Once Soulpulse capacity increases, it never decreases
- Once a relationship changes, it cannot regress without cause

---
