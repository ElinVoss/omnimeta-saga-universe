## ESCALATION PHILOSOPHY

Crises escalate across six Turnings, from **local catastrophe** (N1) to **universe collapse** (N30).

**Escalation Pattern**:
- **GLASS (N1–N5)**: Catastrophic → Chronic → Apocalyptic
- **CRACK (N6–N10)**: Rebuilding → Faction Emergence → Attrition
- **FORGE (N11–N15)**: Ideological Wars → Siege
- **SMELT (N16–N20)**: Grinding Attrition → Stalemate
- **CLEAR (N21–N25)**: Final Preparation → Convergence
- **BREAK (N26–N30)**: Battle Royale → Universe Collapse
