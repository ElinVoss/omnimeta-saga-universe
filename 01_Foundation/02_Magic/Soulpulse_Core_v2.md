## 1. VEIN SUBSTRATE: THE INVISIBLE STRESS ARCHITECTURE

### What Are Veins?

**Veins** are invisible channels of structural stress that exist within all materials (objects, living tissue, the planetary substrate itself).

**Pre-Piercing state:** Veins exist but are **inert**—stress channels locked in place, unresponsive to will or intention.

**Post-Piercing state:** The projectile's alien materials cause **vein-infection**—veins throughout Te'Oga become **responsive to conviction and Soulpulse manipulation**.

### Vein States: Three Conditions

Every vein exists in one of three states:

#### 1. Stable

**Definition:** Veins in equilibrium; stress distributed normally; material/body functioning as intended.

**Indicators:** No sensations; object holds; body healthy; no tremor or pain.

**Manipulation:** Stable veins are difficult to deliberately activate; require high conviction and precise application.

**Narrative use:** Characters describe stable objects as "holding" or "settled"; bodies feel "intact" or "whole".

#### 2. Stressed

**Definition:** Veins under unusual pressure; stress accumulating; material/body approaching failure point.

**Indicators:** Humming sensation; pressure-feeling (like water-weight); localized pain; tremor in proximate tissue.

**Manipulation:** Stressed veins are easiest to manipulate; they respond to conviction quickly; cost is moderate.

**Narrative use:** Characters describe stressed objects as "creaking" or "singing" (forbidden: "humming like a tuning fork"); bodies feel "stretched" or "tight".

#### 3. Rupturing

**Definition:** Veins in cascading failure; stress exceeding maximum threshold; material/body approaching structural collapse.

**Indicators:** Intense pain; visible cracks appearing; explosive sensation (pressure-release imminent); nosebleeds if in living tissue.

**Manipulation:** Rupturing veins cannot be stabilized through normal Soulpulse (cost too high; would kill user); can only be managed through Wholeness-braiding (accepting the failure and integrating around it) or accelerated through Entropy (allowing graceful collapse).

**Narrative use:** Characters describe rupturing objects as "screaming" (forbidden: "singing like a broken instrument"); bodies feel "shattering" or "dissolving from inside".

### Vein Density: Geographic Distribution

Vein density (responsive veins per cubic meter) varies by location post-Piercing:

| Location | Vein Density | Responsiveness | Cost Modifier |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Grindheim (Underface, near entry) | 95%+ | Extreme (veins respond instantly) | x1.5 cost (veins too sensitive) |
| Mid-Underface cities | 70–80% | High (veins respond reliably) | x1.0 cost (baseline) |
| Underface periphery | 40–50% | Moderate (veins respond inconsistently) | x0.8 cost (easier manipulation) |
| Curtain zone | Fluctuates wildly | Chaotic (veins respond unpredictably) | x2.0+ cost (dangerous) |
| Outer Crown entry | 60–70% | High (veins respond reliably) | x1.0 cost (baseline) |
| Mid-Outer Crown | 30–50% | Moderate (veins respond inconsistently) | x0.8 cost (easier manipulation) |
| Outer Crown periphery | 10–20% | Low (veins barely respond) | x0.5 cost (very difficult to activate) |

**Narrative consequence:** Magic is hardest (costliest) in Grindheim; easiest in periphery; fluctuates unpredictably in Curtain zone.

## 2. WHAT SOULPULSE IS (HARD DEFINITION)

### Core Mechanism

**Soulpulse** is the deliberate manipulation of vein state through focused conviction and directed internal energy.

**Process:**
1. User senses vein(s) in a material or living tissue
2. User focuses conviction on specific vein target
3. User channels internal energy (metabolic, emotional, or both) into the target vein
4. Vein responds by shifting state (stable → stressed, stressed → rupturing, or reversed)
5. Material/body responds to vein state change (object strengthens/weakens; wound heals/tears; structure adjusts)

### Prerequisites for Successful Soulpulse

**User must possess:**

1. **Vein sensitivity** — ability to sense veins within materials/bodies
   - Post-Piercing baseline: 70% of population develops some sensitivity
   - Trainable: with practice, sensitivity increases
   - Genetic component: some people naturally gifted; others require years of practice

2. **Conviction** — psychological state of absolute certainty + grounding + acceptance of cost
   - **Certainty:** User must know exactly what they intend to accomplish (vague intentions fail)
   - **Grounding:** User must be emotionally anchored (panic/fear causes manipulation to fail)
   - **Cost acceptance:** User must consciously accept the physical toll (hesitation causes incomplete manipulation or backlash)

3. **Energy reserves** — metabolic and emotional capacity to fuel the manipulation
   - Soulpulse draws on internal energy (blood sugar, emotional intensity, willpower)
   - Depletion causes fatigue, tremor, nosebleeds
   - Different principles draw on different energy types (Form = willpower; Wholeness = emotional; Purity = rage; Entropy = acceptance)

### What Soulpulse CANNOT Do

❌ **Cross significant distances** (must sense veins directly; range ~5 meters maximum with training)  
❌ **Work on dead matter** (veins become inert; no responsiveness)  
❌ **Affect non-biological material** (metals, stone respond weakly; biological substrate responds more readily)  
❌ **Reverse permanent damage** (scarred tissue has dead veins; cannot restore)  
❌ **Save someone at the moment of death** (veins rupture completely; no recovery point)  

---

## 3. ACCESS REQUIREMENT: CONVICTION

### What Is Conviction?

**Conviction** is the triple-state psychological condition required to activate Soulpulse:

#### Element 1: Certainty

**Definition:** Absolute clarity about intended outcome; no ambiguity or hesitation.

**Examples of sufficient certainty:**
- "I will stabilize this child's fractured ribs" (specific, measurable)
- "I will heal the poison in this person's blood" (specific target, clear method)
- "I will strengthen this scaffold until it holds for one hour" (time-bound, specific)

**Examples of insufficient certainty:**
- "I hope I can fix this" (hope is not certainty)
- "Maybe I can stop the bleeding" (doubt present)
- "I'll try to make it better" (vague intention)

**Consequence of insufficient certainty:** Manipulation fails; veins do not respond; no cost incurred but no benefit either.

#### Element 2: Grounding

**Definition:** Emotional stability and presence; ability to remain focused despite pain, fear, or external crisis.

**Grounding sources:**
- Love/attachment (protection of someone you love grounds you in purpose)
- Competence confidence (mastery in your craft grounds you in capability)
- Physical anchoring (feet on ground, breath controlled, body present)
- Community/crew (feeling part of something larger grounds you in collective purpose)

**Threats to grounding:**
- Panic (disassociates you from body/intention)
- Grief (overwhelms focus with emotion)
- Physical injury (pain pulls attention away)
- Doubt about worthiness (moral questioning of whether action is right)

**Consequence of insufficient grounding:** Manipulation fails or causes **backlash**—veins respond incorrectly; user experiences intense pain or temporary paralysis.

#### Element 3: Cost Acceptance

**Definition:** Conscious psychological acceptance of the permanent toll the manipulation will exact.

**What acceptance means:**
- Not intellectually knowing the cost, but *emotionally accepting* it
- Willingness to trade your physical health for the outcome
- Pre-commitment to living with the scar (literal tremor, chronic pain, sensory loss)

**How acceptance fails:**
- User hesitates mid-manipulation (thinking "this will hurt too much")
- User second-guesses the worthiness of outcome (thinking "am I really willing to sacrifice for this?")
- User tries to minimize cost through technique (thinking "I can do this efficiently"; magic doesn't work that way)

**Consequence of insufficient acceptance:** Manipulation fails at critical moment; partial vein activation causes **Hollowing cascade** (see §7).

### Why Conviction Is Difficult

Only ~33% of vein-sensitive people can achieve full conviction under pressure:

- **Certainty failure (most common):** In chaos, people become uncertain; uncertainty blocks manipulation
- **Grounding failure (second most common):** Panic/fear/grief disconnects people from body and intention
- **Cost acceptance failure (rarest but most dangerous):** People flinch from toll; backlash can cause death

**Writer-facing rule:**
- Characters using Soulpulse must consciously demonstrate all three elements
- Cannot skip through them or assume automatic success
- Failure of any element = failed manipulation or backlash

## 4. THE FOUR PRINCIPLES (HARD MECHANICS)

### Principle 1: Form (Corlexi Tradition) — God-Vessel: Xilcore

**What Form does:** Locks veins into geometric precision; structures become perfectly stable within defined patterns.

**Activation mechanism:**
- User visualizes precise geometric pattern (shape, angle, measurement)
- User channels willpower (not emotion; requires cold clarity)
- Veins in target material respond by locking into pattern-alignment
- Result: Structure held in perfect stability for duration of concentration

**Duration:** Lasts as long as user maintains concentration (breaks if user distracted, injured, or concentration lapses)

**Cost per use:**
- **Primary:** Precision fatigue (fine motor tremor develops; worsens with repeated use)
- **Secondary:** Frozen hands (loss of sensation in fingertips; can become permanent if overused)
- **Tertiary:** Rigidity (user's own joints become stiff; chronic tension develops)

**Failure mode:** If user loses concentration while Form-locked, locked structure **snaps back violently**; sudden release of stress energy can cause explosive failure.

**Narrative markers (innocent-frame):**
- User reports feeling "crystal-clear" mentally but "locked" in body
- Structures described as "perfect" or "precise" or "geometrically locked"
- After use: tremor visible in hands; user reports finger numbness

#### Form-Advanced Technique: Dual-Principle Form-Lock

(Tiffani's signature technique; taught to Jhace in N4 Hollowing scene)

**What it does:** Combines Form-locking with Wholeness-braiding to lock internal veins while simultaneously stabilizing around failure points.

**Activation:** Requires wielding both Form and Wholeness simultaneously (normally impossible; Jhace's paradox capacity allows this in N4)

**Effect:** Can stabilize rupturing veins without full healing; maintains function while damaged tissue remains.

**Cost:** Extreme (both Form and Wholeness costs incurred simultaneously; accelerates Hollowing risk)

**Example:** Tiffani using Form to lock Jhace's degraded vein architecture in place while Wholeness-braiding integrates around the damage—keeping him functioning despite Hollowing state.

---

### Principle 2: Wholeness (Salee Tradition) — God-Vessel: Leesa

**What Wholeness does:** Integrates damaged veins together; wounds heal; broken systems mend; living tissue restores.

**Activation mechanism:**
- User focuses emotional conviction on damaged area
- User channels compassion/love/acceptance into target veins
- Veins respond by bridging damaged sections; living tissue integrates around breaks
- Result: Wound heals; function restores (imperfectly; scars remain but tissue is viable)

**Duration:** Permanent (healing integrates vein-bridges into new tissue structure; doesn't fade)

**Cost per use:**
- **Primary:** Tremor (nerve endings stimulated by vein-integration; tremor develops or worsens)
- **Secondary:** Thirst (metabolic exhaustion from healing energy expenditure; requires huge water/food intake)
- **Tertiary:** Emotional weight (user absorbs sensation of pain being healed; experiences phantom aching)

**Failure mode:** If user loses emotional grounding while Wholeness is active, integrated veins **rupture from incomplete bridging**; creates new wound worse than original.

**Narrative markers (innocent-frame):**
- User reports feeling "connected" to injured person; experiences their pain
- Wounds described as "knitting together" or "integrating" or "healing wrong but holding"
- After use: tremor obvious; user extremely thirsty; emotional exhaustion visible

#### Wholeness-Advanced Technique: Dual-Principle Wholeness-Braiding

(Jhace's signature technique; develops organically in N2–N3; refined through N5)

**What it does:** Combines Wholeness with Entropy/Decay to allow healing that accepts failure.

**Activation:** Requires wielding both Wholeness and Entropy simultaneously (Jhace's paradox capacity)

**Effect:** Can heal chronic damage that won't fully restore; integrates around permanent loss without fighting it.

**Cost:** High (both Wholeness and Entropy costs; creates conflicting emotional states—acceptance + hope)

**Example:** Jhace using Wholeness to integrate Bram's poisoned tissue while Entropy-releasing the irreversible damage—accepting that the healing will be incomplete but keeping him alive longer.

---

### Principle 3: Purity (Mobel Tradition) — God-Vessel: Blemo

**What Purity does:** Erases unwanted material; accelerates decay; removes corruption; absolute elimination.

**Activation mechanism:**
- User focuses rage/disgust/judgment on target material
- User channels destructive will into target veins
- Veins respond by accelerating cellular breakdown; material decays rapidly or vaporizes
- Result: Target substance eliminated completely

**Duration:** Immediate effect; not maintained (one-time erasure)

**Cost per use:**
- **Primary:** Addiction (user experiences pleasure from absolute elimination; craves using Purity again)
- **Secondary:** Personality degradation (repeated use erodes empathy; user becomes callous/zealous)
- **Tertiary:** Nerve death (sensory loss in hands/feet; becomes permanent with overuse)

**Failure mode:** If user loses emotional certainty while Purity is active, the acceleration **becomes uncontrollable**; erases more than intended; can cascade (burns through surrounding material uncontrollably).

**Narrative markers (innocent-frame):**
- User reports feeling "clean" or "righteous" after use
- Target material described as "vaporized" or "erased" or "purified away"
- After use: user seems unnaturally calm; asks to use Purity again soon (addiction indicator)

#### Purity-Advanced Technique: Selective Erasure

(Sanitist enforcers' signature technique; dangerous but efficient)

**What it does:** Target Purity at specific material while leaving adjacent material intact.

**Activation:** Requires extreme precision in conviction (target must be defined at molecular level—nearly impossible)

**Effect:** Can remove infection/poison without harming host body (theoretically; usually fails at extremes)

**Cost:** Catastrophic if precision fails; uncontrolled Purity cascade; user and surroundings damaged

**Example:** Sanitist enforcer attempting to burn out poison in victim's bloodstream while preserving organs—extremely rare success; frequent catastrophic failure.

---

### Principle 4: Entropy (Eries Tradition) — God-Vessel: Seeri

**What Entropy does:** Accelerates natural collapse; things break down gracefully; death becomes painless; structures crumble peacefully.

**Activation mechanism:**
- User focuses acceptance/surrender on target system
- User channels surrender into target veins
- Veins respond by allowing graceful degradation; no fighting, no resistance
- Result: System collapses naturally; if living, death is peaceful; if material, decay is swift and complete

**Duration:** Can be maintained (sustained Entropy causes continued slow degradation until target is gone)

**Cost per use:**
- **Primary:** Depression (user absorbs acceptance of loss; becomes numb/apathetic)
- **Secondary:** Loss of ambition (user struggles to start new projects; motivation dampened)
- **Tertiary:** Paralysis (extended use causes catatonia; user loses will to act)

**Failure mode:** If user loses acceptance while Entropy is active, the collapse **becomes chaotic**; system dies painfully or explosively instead of gracefully.

**Narrative markers (innocent-frame):**
- User reports feeling "at peace" or "accepting" after use
- Target described as "crumbling gracefully" or "releasing" or "fading naturally"
- After use: user seems resigned; lacks energy; withdraws from company

#### Entropy-Advanced Technique: Conscious Release

(Philosophers' signature technique; rarest form of Soulpulse)

**What it does:** User voluntarily releases their own vein-tension; eases their own pain through acceptance.

**Activation:** User directs Entropy inward (toward own body); extremely difficult (requires self-acceptance at crisis level)

**Effect:** User experiences pain relief, emotional peace, acceptance of circumstance

**Cost:** Depression, loss of ambition, temporary paralysis; user becomes passive

**Example:** Jhace using Entropy on himself in N4 to ease Hollowing pain—temporarily relieving symptoms but accelerating underlying degradation (dangerous technique; accelerates his decline).

## 5. COST ARCHITECTURE: WHAT MAGIC DEMANDS

### Cost System Overview

**Every use of Soulpulse exacts a permanent or semi-permanent physical toll.**

**No magic is "free."** Every manipulation trades user health for outcome.

### Cost Types: Three Categories

#### Category 1: Immediate Physical Damage (First 24 Hours)

**Tremor:**
- Develops after Wholeness or dual-principle use
- Appears as fine motor shaking (especially in hands)
- Duration: Tremor from single use fades over 2–8 hours; repeated use causes cumulative worsening
- Chronic: After ~50 uses, tremor becomes semi-permanent (present even at rest; only partially fades after use)

**Thirst:**
- Develops after Wholeness use; sometimes after Form use
- Intense craving for water/fluids; metabolic exhaustion feeling
- Duration: Lasts 2–12 hours after use; resolves with food/water/rest
- Chronic: After ~30 uses, baseline thirst becomes permanent (character always slightly dehydrated; requires extra water intake to function)

**Nosebleed:**
- Develops during extreme Soulpulse use (maximum-intensity Form, Wholeness, or Purity)
- Indicates internal vein-resonance damage
- Duration: Bleeding stops within minutes; but indicates underlying damage
- Chronic: After multiple nosebleeds, nasal tissue scarring occurs; chronic epistaxis possible (occasional random nosebleeds)

**Sleep debt:**
- Develops after heavy Soulpulse use
- User exhausted and cannot sleep normally; requires 2–3x normal recovery time
- Duration: Resolves after deep sleep/long rest
- Chronic: After ~40 uses, sleep disruption becomes baseline; character requires more total sleep per night

#### Category 2: Chronic Physical Degradation (Weeks to Months)

**Hand tremor (progressive):**
- Baseline tremor worsens with every use
- Measurement: Jhace's hand loss progression (see Dossier_Jhace.md for exact percentages)
- Mechanism: Nerves in hands become overstimulated; fine motor control permanently degrades
- Point of no return: After ~200 cumulative uses, tremor becomes permanent even without further Soulpulse

**Vein burn (progressive):**
- Specific to Form-users; cumulative burn damage visible on skin
- Measurement: Tiffani's vein-burn progression (see Dossier_Tiffani_Auditor_CounterSpark.md for exact centimeters)
- Mechanism: Repeated Form-locking causes vein-tissue scarring; scar becomes visible as dark lines/burn marks on skin
- Point of no return: After ~150 Form uses, vein-burn becomes permanent (visible forever)

**Chronic pain (regional):**
- Specific to body region used most heavily
- Jhace: Back/shoulder strain from pressure-balancing in Wholeness
- Tiffani: Rib pain from Form-locking around fragile structures
- Mechanism: Repeated vein-stimulation causes chronic nerve inflammation
- Point of no return: After ~100 uses in same region, pain becomes baseline (character always hurting slightly in that location)

**Sensory loss (progressive):**
- Specific to heavy Purity or Entropy users
- Loss of sensation in hands/feet (numbness spreading inward)
- Measurement: Percentage of sensory loss per use (see Dossier specs)
- Mechanism: Nerve endings burned out by repeated vein-acceleration
- Point of no return: After ~80 uses, sensory loss becomes permanent (deadened areas don't recover)

#### Category 3: Terminal Damage — Hollowing (Irreversible)

**What Hollowing is:**
- Complete burnout of vein-response capacity in a localized region (or full-body if extreme)
- Channels shred from overextension; veins become inert even to strong conviction
- Symptoms: Nosebleeds, hallucinations, catatonia, potential death
- Recovery: Uncertain; capacity may be permanently lost even if user survives

**How it develops:**
- Occurs when user pushes Soulpulse beyond sustainable limits
- Triggers: Holding Form for >1 hour continuously; attempting to heal multiple catastrophic wounds in succession; Purity cascades; attempting fivefold principle paradox without preparation

**Manifestation:**
- Phase 1 (hours): Intense nosebleeds, hallucinations, confusion
- Phase 2 (hours–days): Complete shutdown; user enters catatonia; veins fully inert
- Phase 3 (days–weeks): Recovery possible but vein-sensitivity may be permanently reduced or gone

**Example:** Jhace's N4 Hollowing (detailed in Dossier_Jhace.md; triggered by obsessive overwork after Bram's death)

### Cost Table: By Principle

| Principle | Primary Cost | Secondary Cost | Tertiary Cost | Hollowing Risk | Chronic Point |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|---|---|
| **Form** | Precision tremor | Frozen hands | Rigid joints | High (overuse) | ~200 uses |
| **Wholeness** | Fine tremor | Chronic thirst | Emotional weight | Moderate (dual-principle) | ~200 uses |
| **Purity** | Addiction drive | Personality degradation | Nerve death (hands/feet) | VERY HIGH (cascade) | ~80 uses |
| **Entropy** | Depression | Motivation loss | Paralysis/catatonia | Low (unless sustained) | ~250 uses |

## 6. DUAL-PRINCIPLE PARADOX: JHACE'S IMPOSSIBLE CAPACITY

### Why Dual-Wielding Should Kill

**Contradictory principles oppose each other at vein-level:**

- Form = lock veins; Wholeness = release veins (contradiction)
- Purity = erase; Entropy = accept decay (contradiction)
- Any two-principle combination creates **resonance collision** in vein-substrate

**Normal outcome of collision:** Veins shred; channels rupture; user dies instantly.

### Why Jhace Survives

**Innocent-frame explanation:** Unknown survivor's luck; rare aptitude; something about his biology

**Guilty-frame explanation:** Tiffani's deliberate training; he was chosen/designed for this capacity

### Jhace's Specific Paradox: Wholeness + Entropy Hybrid

**What he does:**
- Wields Wholeness (integrate/heal/mend) simultaneously with Entropy (accept decay/allow failure)
- Creates impossible state: "healing while accepting loss"
- Allows him to stabilize deteriorating systems without fighting the deterioration

**Example manifestation:**
- Healing chronic poison by accepting the poison will remain but integrating around it
- Mending shattered bone by accepting it will never be perfect but will function
- Saving someone from Hollowing by accepting they'll never regain full capacity but can survive

**Cost asymmetry:**
- Both Wholeness and Entropy costs incurred simultaneously
- Right hand suffers more damage than left (dominance asymmetry; unclear why)
- Dual-wielding cost = ~1.5x single-principle cost per use

**Danger escalation:**
- Each dual-wielding use pushes him closer to fivefold-principle paradox capacity
- Fivefold paradox (wielding all four simultaneously) = Steal Breaks Open trigger (see N5 ending)

### Writer Constraint: Dual-Principle Usage

**Jhace can dual-wield, but:**

✅ **Allowed in story:**
- N1: First accidental dual-wield (stabilizing child)
- N2–N4: Learning controlled dual-wield (costs become visible)
- N4: Extreme dual-wield (Hollowing scene; Tiffani saves him)
- N5: Steal Breaks Open (all four principles simultaneously; one-time apocalyptic event)

❌ **NOT allowed in story:**
- Any casual dual-wielding (it should feel dangerous, rare, last-resort)
- Any other character attempting dual-wield (only Jhace has capacity)
- Any suggestion that dual-wield can be taught (it cannot; Jhace is unique)

---

## 7. HOLLOWING: TERMINAL FAILURE STATE

### Definition

**Hollowing** is the catastrophic burnout of vein-response capacity; channels shred from overextension; user enters shutdown state.

**Outcome:** Death, permanent incapacity, or rare recovery with reduced capacity.

### Triggering Conditions

**Hollowing occurs when:**

1. User holds Form-lock for >1 hour continuously (veins locked beyond sustainable duration)
2. User attempts multiple catastrophic Wholeness-healings in rapid succession (veins overstimulated)
3. User triggers Purity cascade (uncontrolled erasure spreads through vein-network)
4. User attempts fivefold-principle paradox without preparation (channels overloaded beyond safe limit)
5. User sustains Entropy too long (channels fully accept degradation; stops responding to reversal)

### Manifestation Timeline

**Phase 1: Cascade Initiation (Minutes)**
- Intense nosebleeds (blood pressure spikes in vein-network)
- Hallucinations (vein-stimulation affects sensory processing)
- Confusion/disorientation (neurological disruption)
- User often loses consciousness

**Phase 2: Channel Shutdown (Hours–Days)**
- Complete loss of vein-sensitivity (even strong conviction cannot activate veins)
- Catatonia (user unresponsive; appears dead)
- Body becomes fragile (user cannot move; any physical stress causes injury)
- User cannot eat/drink (swallowing reflex fails)
- Potential death from physical collapse

**Phase 3: Possible Recovery (Days–Weeks)**
- If user survives Phase 2, gradual sensory recovery begins
- Vein-sensitivity returns partially (may never fully return)
- Physical rehabilitation needed (muscles weakened; movement must be relearned)
- Psychological trauma (memory fragmented; user may not remember Hollowing event)

**Post-Hollowing Consequences:**
- Reduced vein-sensitivity (~50% of pre-Hollowing baseline typically)
- Permanent tremor worsening (Hollowing accelerates hand loss by ~5–10%)
- Fear of using Soulpulse (psychological barrier; user hesitates to attempt magic)
- Possible permanent capacity loss (rare; if veins don't recover, user cannot use Soulpulse at all)

### Treatment (If Possible)

**Only Tiffani's dual-principle Form-locks can stabilize Hollowing progression:**

- Uses Form to lock damaged veins in place (preventing further cascade)
- Uses Wholeness to integrate around the damage (accepting permanent loss)
- Result: User survives but vein-capacity permanently reduced

**Example:** Tiffani saving Jhace in N4 (detailed in Dossier_Jhace.md and Canon_Innocent_Master_v2_CORRECTED.md)

## 8. LEARNING BY TRIAL AND ERROR: MECHANICS

### How Soulpulse Is Discovered (Post-Piercing)

**No instruction manual exists.** Magic must be learned through:

1. **Accident:** Character attempts something instinctively; vein responds or rejects
2. **Consequence:** Character experiences result (success or failure or injury)
3. **Adaptation:** Character adjusts approach based on feedback
4. **Skill:** Repeated successful attempts build mastery (and accumulate cost)
5. **Teaching:** Rare; only experienced practitioners can teach (but teaching is imperfect; trial-and-error still dominant)

### Learning Curve: Expected Timeline

**First successful manipulation (any principle):** Turn 1–3 (days to weeks after Piercing)
- Usually accidental (desperation-driven)
- Character surprised it works
- Cost incurred but not understood yet

**Intentional single-principle use:** Turn 4–20 (weeks; trial-and-error dominates)
- Character attempts same principle repeatedly
- Learns to sense when it's working
- Learns cost consequences (tremor, thirst, pain)
- ~30 successful uses needed before reliable control

**Mastery of single principle:** Turns 21–40 (months; repeated careful experimentation)
- Character can activate principle reliably in low-stress situations
- Can maintain stable effect for ~15 minutes without intense difficulty
- Understands cost progression intimately
- Still makes mistakes under pressure

**Competent practitioner status:** Turns 41–80 (months to seasons; heavy use)
- Character can activate principle in crisis (high-stress situations)
- Can integrate multiple principle-applications in sequence
- Understands personal limits (knows when to stop using)
- Cost accumulation becomes visible (chronic tremor, vein-burn, etc.)

**Master status:** Turns 100+ (seasons to years; intensive use)
- Character can teach others (though teaching is imperfect)
- Can activate principle in extreme situations
- Has learned personal mastery limits (when to refuse requests)
- May have attempted dual-principle or reached near-Hollowing

### Trial-and-Error Failure Modes

**Failure type 1: Incomplete activation**
- User tries to activate vein but loses conviction mid-process
- Result: Vein responds partially; creates unstable state; can cause injury
- Example: Attempting Wholeness to heal wound but losing confidence halfway—vein half-heals; new infection develops

**Failure type 2: Backlash**
- User loses grounding/certainty while Soulpulse is active
- Result: Vein responds opposite to intention; causes harm instead of benefit
- Example: Attempting Form-lock but panicking during lock—structure locks wrong; snaps explosively instead

**Failure type 3: Cost miscalculation**
- User underestimates cost and pushes too hard
- Result: Tremor/nosebleeds/pain worse than expected; user incapacitated
- Example: Holding Form-lock for too long thinking they can sustain it—Hollowing cascade begins

**Failure type 4: Principle confusion**
- User activates wrong principle (attempts Wholeness but Purity activates)
- Result: Unintended effect; can cause catastrophic damage
- Example: Attempting to heal poisoned person using Wholeness but Purity activates instead—poison erased but person harmed in process

### Writer-Facing Rule: Trial and Error

**Every first or experimental use of Soulpulse must show:**
- Uncertainty (character unsure if it will work)
- Consequence (positive, negative, or mixed result)
- Learning (character adjusts understanding based on outcome)
- Cost (visible toll incurred)

**Cannot skip through learning process.** Each new technique/principle requires scene-time showing trial-and-error discovery.

## 9. FORBIDDEN LANGUAGE (PROSE LAW INTEGRATION)

### Banned Musical Metaphors (ABSOLUTE)

**The following terms are FORBIDDEN in any Soulpulse context:**

❌ Sing / Singing / Song  
❌ Harmony / Harmonic  
❌ Melody / Melodic  
❌ Orchestrate / Orchestra  
❌ Chord / Chords  
❌ Resonance (in musical sense; "vein-resonance" is OK; "melodic resonance" is NOT)  
❌ Hum / Humming (in musical sense; "humming sensation" of pressure is OK; "humming like a tuning fork" is NOT)  
❌ Tune / Tuning (in musical sense; only OK in clock/device context)  

### Why These Are Banned

Song-language implies:
- External orchestration (suggests manipulation by outside force; defeats Soulpulse as character-driven)
- Predefined harmony (suggests inevitability; defeats discovery through trial-and-error)
- Musical beauty (romanticizes pain; defeats visceral cost consequence)

### Approved Alternatives

**Instead of "sing/song":**
- Hum (pressure-sensation); buzz; whir; pulse; vibrate
- Scream (rupturing sensation); shriek; crack; shatter
- Groan (stressed state); creak; grind; strain

**Instead of "harmony":**
- Alignment; integration; balance; synchronization; coordination

**Instead of "resonance" (musical):**
- Echo; reverberation; vein-response; channel-activation

**Instead of "orchestra/orchestrate":**
- Coordinate; synchronize; arrange; order; pattern

**Instead of "tune":**
- Adjust; calibrate; focus; refine; stabilize

### Prose Law Enforcement

**QC check for every Soulpulse scene:**
- Search for banned musical terms
- Replace with approved alternatives
- Verify no romantic/beautiful language applied to magic (cost should feel visceral, not elegant)
