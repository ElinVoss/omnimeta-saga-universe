## 1. THE PIERCING (N1 CH.3)

### Event Date & Duration

**Temporal notation:** Shaping-to-Striking transition, Rising Glow, 2nd Crucible, 423rd Casting

**Physical duration:** ~30 seconds visible passage; ~3 minutes total vein-shatter activity

### Immediate Consequences (N1 Ch.3–Ch.4)

**Vein-shatter event:**
- **Rupture-grade:** 7.8 (major rupture-event; catastrophic damage to pre-engineered structures)
- **Wave pattern:** Multiple arrivals over ~90 seconds
- **Damage zones:** Severe damage within 50km of entry (Grindheim) and exit (Shatterholm) zones
- **Infrastructure collapse:** 40–60% of exposed structures damaged; heat-grid primary rupture

**Atmospheric event:**
- **Pressure-wave:** Radiates outward at sonic speeds; creates winds up to 100+ mph at epicenter
- **Storm formation:** Immediate localized void-storms at entry/exit zones; unstable weather spreads
- **Sound:** Mechanical shrieking audible for 300+ kilometers; multiple echoes through Bore
- **Visibility:** Sky rupture visible from both hemispheres simultaneously

**Civilian casualties (Grindheim entry zone):**
- Immediate: ~5,000–10,000 deaths (structure collapse; pressure-wave impact; disorientation panic)
- Injured: ~20,000–40,000 (various injuries; overwhelms medical capacity)
- Missing/trapped: ~3,000–5,000 (requires search & rescue; ongoing over N1 Ch.4–15)

**Civilian casualties (Shatterholm exit zone):**
- Similar magnitude to Grindheim; comparable death/injury toll

**Total first-impact casualties:** ~15,000–30,000 dead; ~60,000+ injured; ~6,000–10,000 missing

### N1 Immediate Response (Ch.4–15)

**Heat grid status:** Fractured; 80% capacity loss in primary zones; rerouting urgent

**Infrastructure focus:** Emergency repairs; search & rescue; heat distribution stabilization

**Soulpulse awakening:** First accidental magic uses occur (trial-and-error responses to crisis)

**Refugee movement:** Populations begin fleeing toward perceived safer zones; evacuation corridors activate
