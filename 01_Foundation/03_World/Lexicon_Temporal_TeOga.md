### The Crafted Calendar System

Time flows like molten glass through the sacred mathematics of craft—five tides to shape, seven anneals to perfect, nine crucibles to complete.

---

## **Tide** (Day)

A single rotation of the world, named for the flowing rhythm of molten glass and the inexorable passage of heat through the forge.

**Phrasing:** "Three tides hence" = three days from now

**Daily divisions:**
- **Kindling** (Dawn) — First Tide; call to work; heat-grid activates to daily minimum
- **Pouring** (Mid-morning) — Second Tide; full work begins; peak energy
- **Shaping** (Noon) — Third Tide; peak heat; maximum output
- **Striking** (Afternoon) — Fourth Tide; refinement; precision work
- **Cooling Hour** (Dusk) — Fifth Tide; The Quench; work winds down; heat-grid begins daily rest

**Example usage in prose:**
- "By Kindling, the scaffold was down." (by dawn)
- "They worked through Shaping and into Striking." (through the hottest part of day)
- "The Quench brought reprieve." (evening came)

---

## **Anneal** (Week - 5 days)

The five-day cycle required for proper annealing of significant glassworks. Each day has a craft-name and thematic purpose:

| Order | Name | Meaning | Crafting Stage |
|-------|------|---------|---|
| 1 | **Heattide** | Preparation, gathering materials | Material assembly |
| 2 | **Pourtide** | Beginning work, molten state | Activation/ignition |
| 3 | **Shapetide** | Formation, the peak of creation | Maximum effort |
| 4 | **Striketide** | Refinement, hammer and tool | Precision work |
| 5 | **Cooltide** | Settling, hardening, rest | Integration/completion |

**Phrasing:** "Before the anneal cools" = within the week

**Example usage in prose:**
- "On Striketide, Jhace realized the crack ran deeper." (fourth day of week; refinement work day)
- "They had until Cooltide to finish." (by end of week)
- "Meet me at Pourtide." (second day of week; transition to active work)

---

## **Crucible** (Month - 7 anneals / 35 tides)

Seven anneals, representing the seven stages of a master crucible's use before it must be relined or replaced. The seven anneals within a Crucible are named for the crucible's lifecycle:

| Order | Name | Metaphor | Purpose |
|-------|------|----------|---------|
| 1 | **First Heat** | Foundation setting | Organizational/planning month |
| 2 | **Rising Glow** | Momentum building | Active work month |
| 3 | **Full Blaze** | Peak intensity | Crisis/climax month |
| 4 | **Steady Burn** | Sustainable rhythm | Recovery/stabilization month |
| 5 | **Ember Anneal** | Maintained heat | Consolidation month |
| 6 | **Fading Coals** | Waning intensity | Transition month |
| 7 | **Final Temper** | Hardening/locking | Resolution month |

**Phrasing:** "A crucible of mourning" = a month of grief

**Example usage in prose:**
- "In the Third Anneal, the heat peaked." (mid-month crisis)
- "By Final Temper, she had accepted it." (end of month; acceptance)
- "Mid-crucible, everything changed." (halfway through month; turning point)

---

## **Casting** (Year - 9 crucibles / 315 tides)

Nine Crucibles make one complete Casting—the time required to cast and complete a grand work incorporating both forged metal framework and blown glass panels. The nine Crucibles are grouped into three seasons:

### **First Forge** (Early Season - 3 Crucibles: 1–3)

| Crucible | Name | Character | Narrative Role |
|----------|------|-----------|---|
| 1 | Crucible of Iron Roots | Foundation | Establish; build infrastructure |
| 2 | Crucible of Rising Frames | Structure | Develop; raise stakes |
| 3 | Crucible of Skeletal Form | Completion | Solidify; lock positions |

**Seasonal theme:** The physical infrastructure being built; the skeleton of events forming.

### **The Great Blow** (Middle Season - 3 Crucibles: 4–6)

| Crucible | Name | Character | Narrative Role |
|----------|------|-----------|---|
| 4 | Crucible of Molten Sand | Chaos | Heat increases; instability peaks |
| 5 | Crucible of Crystal Breath | Transition | Critical moment; clarity emerges |
| 6 | Crucible of Prismatic Fire | Transformation | Light breaks through; new vision |

**Seasonal theme:** The crisis escalates; transformation occurs; world shifts perception.

### **Fusion Season** (Late Season - 3 Crucibles: 7–9)

| Crucible | Name | Character | Narrative Role |
|----------|------|-----------|---|
| 7 | Crucible of Marriage | Integration | Metal meets glass; unity forged |
| 8 | Crucible of Setting | Refinement | Precision adjustments; final shape |
| 9 | Crucible of Final Temper | Hardening | Work complete; locked in place |

**Seasonal theme:** Elements combine; final form emerges; year concludes in permanence.

**Phrasing:** "Many castings ago" = many years ago; "Forged before my smelting" = before I was born

**Example usage in prose:**
- "This was the Casting of the Piercing." (the year The Piercing occurred)
- "Three castings hence, they would understand." (three years later)
- "In the Fourth Crucible of that Casting, everything failed." (mid-year crisis moment)

---

## **Smelting** (Decade - 10 castings / 3,150 tides)

The apprenticeship period, representing ten Castings of learning before a craftsperson achieves journeyman status.

**Phrasing:** "Still in my first smelting" = still young/learning; early career

**Age markers:**
- **First Smelting (age 0–10):** Apprentice; learning basics
- **Second Smelting (age 10–20):** Late apprentice; advancing skills
- **Third Smelting (age 20–30):** Journeyman; competent practitioner
- **Fourth Smelting (age 30–40):** Advanced journeyman; teaching others
- **Fifth Smelting (age 40–50):** Master; deep expertise
- **Sixth+ Smelting (age 50+):** Legendary; elder status

**Example usage in prose:**
- "He was not yet through his first smelting when The Piercing came." (young; early twenties)
- "She had lived three smeltings and carried scars from each." (thirty-plus years old)
- "A smelting of service" = a decade of labor

---

## **Masterwork** (Century - 100 castings / 31,500 tides)

The span of a legendary piece's creation and reputation. Great monuments are measured in Masterworks. Historical eras are marked by Masterwork numbers.

**Phrasing:** "Built three Masterworks past" = 300 castings ago (300 years)

**Historical reference:** 
- **First Masterwork of the Heat Grid** = 100-year era when grid was established/expanded
- **Second Masterwork of the Conflict** = 100-year era of major war
- **Third Masterwork of the Piercing** = 100-year era after The Piercing

**Example usage in prose:**
- "That was back in the First Masterwork of the Recovery." (historical reference ~100 years ago)
- "The monument stood for two entire Masterworks." (lasted 200 years)

---

## **Epoch of Fusion / The Great Kiln** (Millennium - 1000 castings / 315,000 tides)

Major eras when revolutionary techniques emerged, typically marked by catastrophic forge-fires or crystalline discoveries that changed civilization. Also called "The Great Kiln" periods.

**Phrasing:** "Since the Second Fusion" = since 2000 castings ago (2000 years); ancient history

**Example usage in prose:**
- "The heat-grid dated from the First Fusion." (ancient; foundational technology)
- "In the Second Epoch, everything transformed." (1000+ years ago; mythic era)

---

## **Eon - The Eternal Crucible**

Geological/mythological time beyond measure. The age of the world itself, imagined as an inexhaustible crucible that holds the molten core of reality.

**Phrasing:** "Older than nine castings" = older than maturity (older than ~30 years); ancient; "As old as the Crucible itself" = eternal/infinite

**Example usage in prose:**
- "The stone was as old as the Crucible." (impossibly ancient; implies world-age timescale)

---

| **The tide turns** | A new day begins; turning point | Transition marker |
| **Through seven anneals** | For the whole month | 1 month (35 days) |
| **By the end of this anneal** | By the end of this week | ~5 days |

## **Calendar Notation**

Dates are written in formal documentation using the format: **Tide / Anneal / Crucible / Casting**

### **Formal Notation Example**

**3/5/7/428** = 3rd Tide of the 5th Anneal of the 7th Crucible of Casting 428

**Interpretation:** 
- Tide 3 = Shaping (noon; peak heat; maximum output)
- Anneal 5 = Ember Anneal (waning intensity; consolidation phase)
- Crucible 7 = Final Temper (hardening; locking in place; year-end resolution)
- Casting 428 = The 428th year (from an epoch reference point)

### **Alternative Notation Formats**

**Formal documentation:**
- **3.5.7.428** (period separators; official records)

**Ceremonial/historical:**
- **Shapetide, Ember Anneal, 7th Crucible, 428th Casting** (full names; formal announcements)

**Casual narrative:**
- "On Striketide of the Final Temper" (character dialogue; poetic)
- "Mid-crucible, 423rd Casting" (narrative time-setting)

## **Narrative Application**

### **N1 Timeline Example**

The Piercing occurs during **First Turning: The Fractured Beginnings (N1–N5)**.

**Example scene dating:**

- **N1 Ch.1:** Shapetide, Rising Glow, 2nd Crucible, 423rd Casting (afternoon; normal work day)
- **N1 Ch.3 (Piercing Event):** Shaping-to-Striking transition, Rising Glow, 2nd Crucible, 423rd Casting (crisis occurs mid-day; heat peaks)
- **N1 Ch.15 (End of N1):** Cooltide, Full Blaze, 3rd Crucible, 423rd Casting (week later; crisis mode ongoing; end of month crisis)

**Character dialogue example:**
- "By Kindling tomorrow, we need repairs finished." (by dawn; immediate deadline)
- "This crucible has been relentless." (the last month has been intense)
- "I've seen only three smeltings, but nothing like this." (young person; ~15–25 years old; experienced but not ancient)
