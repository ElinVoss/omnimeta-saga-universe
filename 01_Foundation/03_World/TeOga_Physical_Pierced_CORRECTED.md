## 1. PRE-PIERCING WORLD STATE

### The Bore: Sealed Cylindrical Void

**Physical description (pre-Piercing):**
- Cylindrical wound through planet (entry/exit at hemispheric boundaries)
- **Diameter:** ~30 kilometers (consistent, visible from space)
- **Depth:** Full planetary penetration (passes completely through Te'Oga from entry to exit)
- **State:** SEALED — impenetrable barrier; no passage through; void maintains stability through unknown mechanism

**Why sealed:**
- Innocent-frame belief: Ancient seal from God War (the Severing); magic or craft-law locked it
- Guilty-frame reality: Deliberately sealed to contain vein-infection until triggering event (Tiffani's orchestration)

**Pre-Piercing consequences of sealed Bore:**
- Bifurcated planet: Underface and Outer Crown isolated
- Curtain zone unstable (pressure differential trying to equalize)
- Heat grid functions through indirect routing (not through Bore; around it)
- No direct atmospheric transfer between hemispheres

---

### Pre-Piercing Gravity

**Asymmetry due to Bore:**
- Gravity shifted ~0.3% toward Outer Crown (entry-hemisphere)
- Not enough to cause physical problems; compass/navigation oddities
- Inhabitants notice "heaviness" at equator (transitional zone)
- Water always flows toward Outer Crown (slight bias)

---

## 2. THE PIERCING: EVENT MECHANICS

### The Projectile

**Physical description:**
- **Shape:** Straight cylinder; same diameter as the Bore (~30km)
- **Composition:** Glass, iron, pewter, tin, sand, alien sediments (see §6)
- **Entry point:** Through entry-hemisphere atmosphere
- **Exit point:** Completely through planet; exits exit-hemisphere atmosphere
- **Velocity:** Impossible speed (faster than sound; possibly near orbital velocity)
- **Sound:** Mechanical shrieking, glass-shattering resonance (describable sound; not magical)

### The Event Sequence (N1 Ch.3)

**Seconds 0–5 (First awareness):**
- Sky cracks open above Grindheim and Shatterholm
- Projectile visible as geometric impossibility moving through sky
- Initial shock: citizens witness phenomenon that violates craft-law
- Sound arrives ~5 seconds after first sighting (delayed transmission)

**Seconds 5–30 (Main passage):**
- Projectile passes completely through Te'Oga
- Duration of visible passage: ~20–30 seconds per location
- Sky ruptures and reforms; atmospheric displacement visible
- Pressure-wave radiates outward; buildings sway; objects fall

**Seconds 30–90 (Aftermath phase):**
- Projectile exits opposite hemisphere (seen from Outer Crown)
- Atmospheric rupture begins closing (vacuum-collapse effect)
- Pressure-waves propagate globally; vein-shatter waves begin
- Sound echoes through Bore; multiple arrivals of shock-waves
- Citizens experience confusion and panic; communication chaos

**Minutes 1–60 (Consequence cascade):**
- Vein-shatter followshocks begin (rupture-grade 7.5–8.0; multiple waves)
- Atmospheric turbulence becomes standard in entry/exit zones
- Heat grid destabilizes (rupture disrupts resonance networks)
- Refugees flee toward stable zones; evacuation corridors activate

---

### What The Piercing Does (Immediate Effects)

1. **Severs the Bore completely** — Seal ruptures; straight gaping hole opens through world; no more impenetrable barrier

2. **Leaves physical scar** — Entry and exit wounds remain open permanently; atmospheric continuity established

3. **Creates atmospheric rupture** — Pressure differential at entry/exit zones causes persistent storm-like conditions

4. **Injects alien materials** — Projectile fragments embed in rupture zone; unknown elements contaminate local area

5. **Activates vein-infection** — Alien materials trigger global vein-response; Soulpulse becomes possible worldwide

6. **Disrupts heat grid** — Resonance networks fractured; heat distribution destabilized; heat-grid repair becomes N1+ priority

7. **Generates vein-shatter catastrophe** — Rupture-grade 7.5–8.0 rupture-waves propagate globally; infrastructure damage zones

---

## 3. POST-PIERCING WORLD STATE

### The Open Wound

**Bore status (post-Piercing):**
- **No longer sealed** — straight gaping hole; permanent open passage
- **Entry/exit wounds visible** — sky visible from opposite hemisphere through hole
- **Atmospheric exchange** — air flows between hemispheres through Bore (weakly; pressure still trying to equalize)
- **Escape to void** — now possible; falling upward through Bore leads to vacuum/void (lethal)

### Hemispheric Connection

**Pre-Piercing:** Underface and Outer Crown isolated by Curtain; no direct passage

**Post-Piercing:** Direct line-of-sight between hemispheres; can communicate across Bore; travel theoretically possible (practically: dangerous)

**New routes:**
- Aerial: Flight through Bore to opposite hemisphere (dangerous; wind turbulence extreme)
- Ground/infrastructure: No new ground routes (Bore is air passage only; no suspended platforms pre-exist)

### Atmospheric Consequences at Entry/Exit

**Entry zone (Grindheim region):**
- Pressure differential creates persistent wind currents (flowing upward toward exit)
- Temperature fluctuations (atmospheric mixing at pressure boundary)
- Humidity increases (moisture from lower hemisphere pulled up)
- Sky visible: Clear view of Outer Crown atmosphere/landscape

**Exit zone (Shatterholm region):**
- Pressure differential creates persistent wind currents (flowing downward toward entry)
- Temperature fluctuations (atmospheric mixing; cooler entry-zone air mixing with warmer exit-zone air)
- Humidity decreases (moisture pulled downward)
- Sky visible: Clear view of Underface atmosphere/landscape

**Curtain zone (mid-zones between entry/exit):**
- Pressure differential equalizes; turbulence decreases gradually toward center
- Wind currents weaken but remain persistent
- Humidity transitions gradually

## 4. ATMOSPHERIC CONSEQUENCES

### Air Flow Pattern Post-Piercing

**Global circulation change:**
- Pre-Piercing: Atmospheric circulation two-tier (Underface layer, Outer Crown layer; separate)
- Post-Piercing: Atmospheric circulation now three-layer (Underface, Bore central exchange, Outer Crown)

**Bore as atmospheric vent:**
- Low-pressure zone in Bore creates upward air suction from Underface
- High-pressure zone at exit creates downward air ejection into Outer Crown
- Net effect: Wind patterns globally disrupted; new baseline weather patterns emerge

### Storm Formation

**Post-Piercing baseline:** Persistent atmospheric instability around entry/exit zones

**Storm triggers:** Any pressure-change event (additional vein-shatter activity, seasonal pressure shifts) can trigger severe localized void-storms

**Stability timeline:**
- N1–N5: Storm conditions persist; atmosphere in chaotic transition
- N6–N10: Storms become less frequent; new patterns establish
- N11+: Baseline weather stabilizes; storms predictable seasonally

### Atmospheric Loss

**Slow escape through Bore:**
- Planetary atmosphere gradually escaping through open Bore passage
- Rate: Negligible on human timescale (~0.001% per Casting at baseline)
- Long-term consequence (100+ Castings): Measurable atmosphere loss; world increasingly cold/thin

**Narrative consequence:** Not immediately critical (within N1–N30 scope), but hints at long-term planetary decay

---

## 5. GRAVITATIONAL CONSEQUENCES

### Gravity Shift

**Pre-Piercing asymmetry:** ~0.3% bias toward Outer Crown

**Post-Piercing asymmetry:** ~0.5% bias toward Outer Crown (slight increase; Bore loss decreases mass)

**Consequence:** Negligible on human scale; compass/navigation shift minor (1–2 degrees); water flow remains slightly biased toward Outer Crown

### Core Exposure

**Bore opening reveals:** Planetary core visible through Bore (glowing region; heat source visible from space)

**Heat consequences:** Core radiation now directly exposed to void; planetary heat loss increases slightly

**Heat grid connection:** Heat grid originally tapped core through shielded channels; Bore opening compromises shielding

## 6. PROJECTILE COMPOSITION AND VEIN-INFECTION

### Projectile Material Analysis (Innocent Frame)

**Observable composition:**
- **Glass** (crystalline, transparent sections; unknown origin)
- **Iron** (ferrous core; magnetic; dark-colored)
- **Pewter/Tin** (silvery alloy coating; conductive)
- **Sand and sediment** (accumulated particulates; suggests long transit through various environments)
- **Unknown alien materials** (unidentifiable; cause unprecedented vein-response)

**Mass:** Incalculable (not measured in innocent frame; no scale established)

**Density:** Higher than stone; projectile fell through atmosphere without burning (unknown why; innocent frame: mystery)

### Vein-Infection Mechanism

**How alien materials activate veins:**
- Unknown mechanism (innocent frame: forbidden from investigating)
- Alien materials emit frequencies that resonate with Te'Ogan vein-substrate
- Frequencies activate previously-inert veins; make them responsive to willful manipulation
- Infection spreads through vein-network; global within days (N1–N2)

**Vein-infection characteristics:**
- Not biological infection (no disease symptoms)
- Permanent (veins remain responsive; no deactivation possible)
- Gradual spread (fastest in high-vein-density zones like Grindheim)
- Affects all materials (stone, metal, glass, living tissue)

**Innocent-frame explanation:** The Piercing awakened latent potential in world's vein-substrate; magic was always possible, just sealed away

## 7. WRITER CONSTRAINTS

### Allowed Descriptions (Post-Piercing World)

✅ **Sky opened/cracked** (literal rupture of sealed barrier)  
✅ **Hole through world** (straight gaping passage visible)  
✅ **Wind from sky** (atmospheric pressure differential causing flows)  
✅ **Can see through to other hemisphere** (line-of-sight possible)  
✅ **Heat from core visible** (glowing region through Bore)  
✅ **Pressure changes** (atmospheric pressure fluctuation at boundaries)  
✅ **New weather patterns** (void-storms emerging from atmospheric instability)  
✅ **Vein-shatter followshocks** (continued rupture-wave movement from rupture)  

### Forbidden Descriptions (Innocent Frame)

❌ **"The seal was broken by design"** (suggests orchestration; investigation locked until N25+)  
❌ **"The projectile was sent"** (suggests agency/intent; Piercing is "natural disaster" in innocent frame)  
❌ **"The world is dying"** (atmosphere loss too slow to be described as immediate crisis)  
❌ **"This was predicted"** (no precognition available; Piercing is surprise event)  
❌ **"The Bore was always meant to open"** (implies predestination; forbidden until guilty-canon reveal)  

### Forbidden After N24 (Until N25+ Unlock)

❌ **"The Bore's origin is..." (any speculation about purpose/maker)**  
❌ **"The projectile came from..." (any reference to alien world/source)**  
❌ **"The vein-infection was deliberate..." (any suggestion of intentional design)**  

**These become allowed at N25+ when investigation begins.**

## 8. GEOGRAPHIC IMPACT ZONES

### Primary Impact Zone: Entry (Grindheim Region)

**Immediate radius (0–50km):**
- Severe atmospheric turbulence
- Vein-shatter damage (structures cracked; infrastructure compromised)
- Heat grid fracture (local disruption; heat flow interrupted)

**Secondary radius (50–200km):**
- Moderate atmospheric effects (wind, pressure changes)
- Moderate vein-shatter damage (cracks; minor collapses)
- Heat grid regional disruption

**Tertiary radius (200km+):**
- Minor atmospheric effects (weather changes)
- Minor vein-shatter effects (tremor; no structural damage typically)
- Heat grid global disruption (all routes compromised; rerouting needed)

### Primary Impact Zone: Exit (Shatterholm Region)

**Same three-tier impact as Entry zone; symmetric effects**

### Secondary Impact Zones: Mid-Hemisphere

**Regions between Entry and Exit:**
- Moderate vein-shatter effects (propagation delay; multiple wave arrivals)
- Minor atmospheric effects (pressure-waves; wind gusts)
- Heat grid global disruption
