## ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION: Modern Earth Terminology

No modern Earth words or contemporary concepts appear in any deliverable.

Te'Oga is a forge-glass culture in renaissance-to-industrial transition. Citizens speak in craft and material metaphors. Scientific terminology must feel indigenous to the world, not imported from Earth.
