# N01 Story Bible — Grip That Holds [INNOCENT_FRAME]

## Core Premise
A concise, spoiler-safe premise rooted in visible costs and ritual shown, not explained.

## Tone & Style Constraints (LAW)
- No forbidden modern terms (see Forbidden_Modern_Terms_TeOga_Alternatives.md)
- No ledger language in prose; no music metaphors
- Cost visible on-page; ritual is demonstrated
- 15-chapter cadence; interludes per design

## Worldframe (Innocent-Safe)
- Te'Oga: forgepunk and glasscraft cultures; bore-through scar as lived reality
- Timekeeping: Bells
- Gods framed as Principles; no orchestration spoilers

## Cast (Innocent)
- Jhace Torrins: competency profile, public motives, visible flaws
- Tiffani Merrow: strategic posture, public motives, visible flaws
- Secondary crew (innocent dossiers only)
- Recurring figures: roles the reader can see, nothing hinted beyond innocents

## Magic & Limits (Soulpulse)
- What is observable
- Costs the reader can witness
- Banned: system-y exposition or meta

## Locations & Setpieces
- Habitats, forges, glassworks, transit, bore-perimeter structures
- Environmental pressures that surface cost

## Objects & Motifs
- Glass, steel, gears; living architecture implications
- Motifs readers can track without meta

## Chapter Cadence (15)
1. Inciting fracture
2. Cost revealed
3. First craft-solution fails
4. Pressure escalates
5. Ally introduced (visible stakes)
6. Ritual demonstrated (no exposition)
7. Midpoint: price accepted
8. Consequence hits the crew
9. Second craft-solution warps the plan
10. Breach widens; public cost
11. Salvage or sacrifice
12. Mass friction; bonds tested
13. Line that holds
14. Aftershock and reckoning
15. Closure with unanswered, innocent-safe threads

### Interlude A (mask POV, innocent-safe)
- Narrow, ritualized lens; no foreshadow-by-negation

### Interlude B (mask POV, innocent-safe)
- Pattern echo; visible cost, still no meta

## Beats ↔ Scenes Map
- Bullet-point beats mapped to the 15-chapter spine (innocent-safe only)

## Forbidden Lexicon Gate
- Confirm all replacements for modern terms are applied here

## LAW_TEST Checklist (inline)
- [ ] Forbidden terms check
- [ ] Innocent frame only
- [ ] Costs visible on-page
- [ ] 15-chapter cadence intact
- [ ] No ledger language in prose
- [ ] No music metaphors
