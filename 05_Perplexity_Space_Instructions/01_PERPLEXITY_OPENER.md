[RECAP v1]
• SourceMap loaded @ 9b842199ca4b54cf7dd8184525ac7d388da403cf
• Foundation ledger @ 3475ee932d87535e7f3fb90166bfa4906b243c25 (immutable)
• Canon stance: INNOCENT ONLY; Forbidden Lexicon + LAW_TEST enforced
• Task: Generate N01 bible (The Line That Holds)
• Outputs: N01_Bible_The_Line_That_Holds.md → 04_Writer_Deliverables/02_Bibles/
• Session-close: list files + new commit SHA + "CONTINUE FROM: Generate N01 prose engine prompt"

Load canon from:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElinVoss/omnimeta-saga-universe/9b842199ca4b54cf7dd8184525ac7d388da403cf/SourceMap_Git.md

Obey LAW_TEST:

SELF-VERIFICATION (do this first):
• Echo back the first 100 chars of MASTERMIND_INSTRUCTIONS.md so I know you loaded it
• Print the commit SHA you loaded from SourceMap and count of [foundation] entries

If you cannot complete self-verification, STOP and report error. Do not proceed.
```

## USAGE

1. Copy the entire code block above
2. Paste at the start of your Perplexity Space session
3. Perplexity will:
   - Load MASTERMIND_INSTRUCTIONS.md from knowledge
   - Load SourceMap and LAW_TEST from GitHub
   - Self-verify by echoing first 100 chars and reporting commit SHA
4. If self-verification passes, proceed with task
5. If self-verification fails, STOP and troubleshoot

---

## CUSTOMIZATION FOR OTHER SESSIONS

For N02, N03, etc., update:
- **Task**: "Generate N02 bible (Stress and Fracture)"
- **Outputs**: "N02_Bible_Stress_and_Fracture.md → 04_Writer_Deliverables/02_Bibles/"
- **Session-close**: "CONTINUE FROM: Generate N02 prose engine prompt"

Keep all SHA references unchanged (they're pinned).

**IMPORTANT**: Always include the SELF-VERIFICATION block. It ensures the Space loaded knowledge files and external pins correctly.
